# Site Architecture — Recoverlution

Keep the flag: Recovery — now runs in real life. Voice: claim → human truth → inevitable outcome. No feature dumps; reveal the system.

## Pages and Spines
- **Home**
  - Hero: Recovery — now runs in real life.
  - Flow: Life doesn’t wait → The loop (READ/ROUTE/DELIVER/SEAL) → Proof (Receipt/Transfer/Trajectory) → MTTR → Humans when humans matter → Choose your world → Close.
  - CTAs: Choose your world · See how it works.
- **How it works**
  - Built for timing (state-first principle).
  - Loop: READ → ROUTE → DELIVER → SEAL (with “Why this, why now”).
  - Two-speed engine: Journeys + NaviCues.
  - Proof as currency: Action → Artifact/Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.
  - ATLAS + MTTR.
  - Escalation: Humans when humans matter.
  - Data dignity: Quiet by default; consent by design.
- **Proof**
  - Proof, without punishment.
  - Stack: Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.
  - MTTR tie-in: Return gets faster.
  - Use cases across worlds: Identity (Individual), Signal (Professional), Defensibility (Org).
- **Technology**
  - Built for timing (state-first computing).
  - Governed delivery (LUMA vow, “why this, why now”).
  - Closed-loop learning (reinforce what worked).
  - Trust boundary: Quiet by default; cadence rules; escalation built in.
- **Trust (Data Dignity)**
  - Quiet by default. Consent by design.
  - Proof without punishment.
  - Humans when humans matter.
  - Principles list (compliance-friendly, plain language).
- **Choose your world**
  - Individual (Companion): Stay oriented. The moment layer. Proof for identity.
  - Professionals (Console): Your work — extended. Signal, not noise. Proof for clinical signal.
  - Organisations (Command Center): Continuity — built in. Outcomes you can defend. Proof for defensibility.
- **For Individuals**
  - Hero: Stay oriented.
  - Flow: The moment matters → Cue/Move/Receipt → Return history (MTTR) → Support graph → Quiet by default → CTA: Start with Companion.
- **For Professionals**
  - Hero: Your work — extended.
  - Flow: The gap is the enemy → Signal (what held/slipped, return speed) → Mindblock Studio/Contract (implied) → Escalation queue → Practice rails → CTA: Explore the Console.
- **For Organisations**
  - Hero: Continuity — built in.
  - Flow: Discharge is a handoff → Cohort return curves (MTTR) → Transfer verification → Evidence/Accreditation mapping → Integrity logs → Escalation load/capacity → CTA: See the Command Center.

## Sections/Blocks to Reuse
- Loop explainer (READ/ROUTE/DELIVER/SEAL) with microcopy.
- Proof strip (Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory) with MTTR line.
- LUMA vow block (Trust boundary).
- Data dignity block (Quiet by default. Consent by design.).
- Escalation block (Humans when humans matter.).
- Capabilities strip: Journeys / NaviCues / LUMA / Proof / ATLAS / Escalation / Data Dignity.
- One-line truths per install (for cards):
  - Mindblock Studio — Recovery, compiled into atomic moves.
  - Contract Compiler — No move ships without proof and transfer.
  - Resistance Engine — Resistance is routing data.
  - Connector Hub — Real life becomes timing.
  - Support Graph — Humans are part of the infrastructure.
  - Evidence Product — Outcomes you can defend.
  - Practice Foundation — Your practice, on rails.

## Tone + Formatting Guards
- Short lines, verb-first. No streaks/engagement/gamified language.
- One idea per block; no defending. Micro-lines to reinforce inevitability.
- Avoid dashboards/metrics dumping; keep it human-legible and “proof without punishment.”
