## Home (flow)
Hero → The gap (life doesn’t wait) → Loop (READ/ROUTE/DELIVER/SEAL) → Proof + MTTR (Receipt/Transfer/Trajectory + Mean Time To Return) → Humans when humans matter (escalation) → Choose your world → Close.

## How it works
- Built for timing (state-first principle)
- The loop: READ (state/readiness/resistance) → ROUTE (target/dose: schema/family/mindblock + stance/primitive + proof/transfer) → DELIVER (Journeys weekly + NaviCues in-moment, LUMA conducting “why this, why now”) → SEAL (Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory; MTTR tracked)
- Two-speed engine: Journeys (baseline) + NaviCues (moment)
- Proof as currency: Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory
- ATLAS + MTTR (measurement spine)
- Escalation protocol: change delivery → change target → human → safety rails
- Data dignity: quiet by default; consent by design; proof without punishment

## Proof
- Proof, without punishment
- Stack: Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory
- MTTR tie-in: return gets faster; baseline steadies
- Use-cases per world: Identity (Companion), Signal (Console), Defensibility (Command Center)
- Example receipts/transfer moments (human-readable, no dashboards)

## Technology
- Built for timing (state-first computing)
- Governed delivery: Contract (target + primitive + proof + transfer), cadence rules
- LUMA vow: why this, why now; appropriate, not improvised
- Closed-loop learning: reinforce what worked; prevent drift

## Trust (Data Dignity)
- Quiet by default. Consent by design.
- Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.
- Humans when humans matter (escalation built in).
- Principles: cadence rules, quiet hours, consent scopes, auditability.

## Choose your world
- **Individual (Companion)**: Stay oriented; Cue → Move → Receipt; MTTR view; Support Graph (roles/consent); Connector Hub (purpose-bound); quiet by default; CTA: Start with Companion.
- **Professionals (Console)**: Your work — extended; Signal (what held/slipped/return speed); Mindblock Studio (atomic endpoints), Contract Compiler (proof+transfer), Escalation queue (ρ), Practice rails; CTA: Explore the Console.
- **Organisations (Command Center)**: Continuity — built in; Cohort MTTR curves; Transfer verification; Evidence mapping; Integrity logs; Escalation load/capacity; CTA: See the Command Center.

## Reusable blocks
- Loop explainer (READ/ROUTE/DELIVER/SEAL + “why this, why now”)
- Proof strip (Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory) + MTTR line
- LUMA vow (trust boundary)
- Data dignity block (Quiet by default. Consent by design.)
- Escalation block (Humans when humans matter.)
- Capabilities strip: Journeys / NaviCues / LUMA / Proof / ATLAS / Escalation / Data Dignity
- One-line truths per install:
  - Mindblock Studio — Recovery, compiled into atomic moves.
  - Contract Compiler — No move ships without proof and transfer.
  - Resistance Engine — Resistance is routing data.
  - Connector Hub — Real life becomes timing.
  - Support Graph — Humans are part of the infrastructure.
  - Evidence Product — Outcomes you can defend.
  - Practice Foundation — Your practice, on rails.
