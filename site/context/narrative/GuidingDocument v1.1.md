# GuidingDocument v1.1

## 1) What we’re actually building (INTENSE DETAIL)

### The core thesis

You’re not building a “recovery app.”

You’re building **an installation system**.

Meaning:

- Not *more insight*.
- Not *more content*.
- But **repeatable nervous-system-and-identity change, installed inside real life**, then proven.

That’s the platform’s spine:

- **OS** = neuroadaptive pacing + readiness alignment (“load aligned to biology”)
- **ORBIT** = composable ecosystem and continuity network (“one platform, every device… unified support ecosystem”)
- **PROOF** = ethical currency (audit-ready evidence that makes outcomes legible and defensible)

### The platform promise (what we do that treatment + content libraries can’t)

Traditional treatment creates breakthroughs **in session**.

Then the patient walks into:

- triggers,
- friction,
- loneliness,
- and biology that doesn’t care what they “know.”

Your platform exists to **extend therapeutic standard into the moment of decision**—without turning everything into surveillance or fluff.

So the mission is:

**Keep the therapeutic signal alive between sessions**

and turn “I get it” into “I do it” under load.

### The clinical system underneath (what makes it credible)

Your own clinical blueprint already states the true model:

Addiction and relapse are maintained by:

- sensitized wanting,
- stress-system drift (allostasis),
- habit circuitry,
- impaired top-down control under load,
- and social context.

So the remission path isn’t “more insight.”

It’s a staged rebuild:

**stabilize physiology → widen tolerance → rebuild appraisal flexibility → restore social connection → re-author identity → improve decision quality**

That’s literally your six pillars in sequence.

### The delivery architecture (how change actually gets installed)

You’ve already defined a two-speed engine:

### A) Journeys (weekly installation cycles)

Journeys are not “modules.”

They’re **cadenced neuroplastic loops** built on ERA (Experience → Recognise/Reflect → Align/Anchor).

Why that matters:

- weekly repetition builds durable pathways
- reflection consolidates meaning
- anchoring converts meaning into behaviour

So Journeys are your **curriculum spine**.

### B) NaviCues (moment-level precision)

NaviCues aren’t “notifications.”

They’re **micro-interventions** delivered contextually, based on:

- state,
- journey position,
- therapeutic aim,
- and readiness.

So NaviCues are your **in-the-moment steering**.

### C) LUMA (orchestration + explainability)

LUMA isn’t “AI chat.”

It’s the orchestration layer that makes the system feel:

- timed,
- personal,
- and *clinically coherent* (“why this, why now”).

### The biological principle that makes this non-negotiable

You’ve hard-coded the governing law:

**Regulate first at high arousal. Reframe when settled. End with action or co-regulation.**

That is the difference between:

- “smart content”
    
    and
    
- **state-matched intervention science** (your own JITAI positioning).

### The measurement principle (how this becomes “real”)

The system must create **evidence**, not vibes.

Your MD explicitly frames “Proof of Change” as multi-evidence:

- receipts
- practice logs
- transfer tests
- prediction errors
- state shifts
- witness confirmations
    
    …and then **scores by scope** (global, schema, mindblock, family, context).
    

So progress is not:

- “they said they feel better.”

Progress is:

- *they returned faster*,
- *they chose differently under load*,
- *the new move transferred to new contexts*,
- *and there are artifacts that prove it.*

### The North Star metric (why CEOs and neuroscientists both get it)

You’ve named it:

**MTTR — Mean Time To Return.**

Not “engagement.”

Not “minutes listened.”

Return speed.

That’s a metric:

- clinicians respect (stability, relapse prevention),
- neuroscientists recognize (state dynamics / recovery half-life),
- CEOs can operationalize (outcomes, retention, differentiation).

### The audio layer (why your system has an unfair advantage)

You’ve declared audio isn’t a feature.

It’s **infrastructure**.

Your soundbite ontology is already defined as runnable molecules:

- **Spark** = interrupt (Downshift, red)
- **Flame** = pivot (Name Pattern, amber)
- **Ember** = integration (Capture Receipt, green)

Then the “Affective Compiler” concept makes it uniquely Recoverlution:

- Guru wisdom + the user’s own “voice receipts”
- stitched into identity-level reinforcement loops

This is why your endgame isn’t “education.”

It’s **self-verification**.

### What this section locks (so the skyscraper holds)

**Definition of the product:**

A neuroadaptive installation engine that:

1. routes by biology first
2. delivers mechanisms through Journeys + NaviCues
3. orchestrates with LUMA
4. captures proof artifacts
5. converts KBE into Embodiment
6. optimizes MTTR, not “time spent”

### Measurement hook

From day one, every delivery surface (Journeys, NaviCues, audio) must output **Receipts + Transfer** so MTTR and embodiment are provable—not inferred.

## 2) The canonical stack

### Pillar → Concept → Theme → Schema → Family → Mindblock (INTENSE DETAIL)

This is the spine that makes everything else non-scrappy.

If this stack is clean, you can scale:

- content
- clinicians
- organizations
- and algorithmic routing
    
    without losing meaning.
    

If this stack is messy, mindblocks become a “bucket of words” and your Visualizer becomes theatre.

So here’s the locked definition of each layer, why it exists, how it should behave, and what it must output.

---

# The Stack as a System of Constraints

## The one rule that governs the whole stack

**Each layer has exactly one job.**

- Pillar = *domain*
- Concept = *mechanism cluster*
- Theme = *trainable skill family*
- Schema = *maintaining predictive model*
- Family = *real-world expression cluster*
- Mindblock = *atomic target unit*

If you let any layer do another layer’s job, you get drift.

Example of drift:

- Themes become “topics”
- Schemas become “tags”
- Families become “format types”
- Mindblocks become “affirmations”
    
    …and you lose clinical authority.
    

The stack prevents that.

---

# Layer 1: Pillar

## What it is

A Pillar is a **capacity domain**: the category of human functioning you’re rebuilding.

It answers:

> “What capability is this person regaining so that recovery works in real life?”
> 

## Why it’s valuable

Pillars are your “clinical rooms” — the stable architecture that stays true even as content changes.

They also protect the system from trend drift.

New modality? Fine.

New guru? Fine.

New content format? Fine.

The Pillars stay.

## What a Pillar must contain

A Pillar must have:

- a therapeutic aim (human outcome)
- the clinical mechanisms it trains
- how it shows up when impaired
- how it shows up when restored
- a measurement signature (what “better” looks like)

You already do this in your pillar theses and blueprint (aim, mechanism, interventions, contraindications, measures).

## The six clinical Pillars (locked)

- Emotional Regulation
- Stress Resilience
- Social Connectivity
- Cognitive Reframing
- Identity Integration
- Decision Mastery

(“Onboarding” is delivery/phase; don’t let it pollute the clinical six.)

---

# Layer 2: Concept

## What it is

A Concept is a **mechanism cluster**.

Not a skill.

Not a topic.

Not a schema.

Concepts answer:

> “Which internal system are we changing?”
> 

## Why Concepts exist

Because Pillars are too broad to route interventions precisely.

Concepts give you:

- targeting precision without chaos
- mechanism-based credibility (neuroscientists instantly get it)
- stable “middle nodes” so families and mindblocks don’t balloon

## What a Concept must be

A Concept must describe a cluster of processes that:

- move together clinically,
- have coherent neuro/behavior logic,
- and can be trained.

Examples:

- interoception + affect labeling
- inhibitory control + time horizon
- co-regulation + attachment safety

## Concept anti-patterns (forbid)

- “Confidence”
- “Self-esteem”
- “Mindfulness”
    
    These are too broad / too loaded; they belong as *Themes* or *outcomes*, not Concepts.
    

## What a Concept must output

A Concept must yield:

- the trainable Themes that reliably change it
- the Schemas it most often interacts with
- the state gates (when it’s accessible)

This is where you protect “regulate first, then reframe” as a principle.

Some concepts are accessible under heat; some are not.

---

# Layer 3: Theme

## What it is

A Theme is a **trainable skill family**.

Themes answer:

> “What do we practice repeatedly that produces change?”
> 

## Why Themes exist

Because Concepts are still too abstract.

Themes translate mechanisms into teachable repetition.

Themes are where a therapist recognizes:

- DBT skill modules
- ACT processes
- CBT techniques
- MI micro-skills

…but without letting any one framework hijack the stack.

## Theme rule (locked)

Themes are **mechanisms of change**, not content categories.

A theme is valid only if:

- it can be trained in <10 minutes,
- repeated daily,
- and measured through proof artifacts.

## Theme outputs (must have)

Every Theme should specify:

- primary primitive (one of the eight)
- best heat band
- best voice stances (how to deliver)
- expected proof types

This is how Themes become executable.

## Theme anti-patterns (forbid)

- “Shame” as a theme
- “Trauma” as a theme
    
    Those are domains or schema clusters; Themes are what you do about them.
    

---

# Layer 4: Schema

## What it is

A Schema is a **maintaining predictive model**.

It answers:

> “What deep rule keeps generating the same loop?”
> 

Schemas are not just beliefs.

They are:

- a perception bias,
- an emotion expectation,
- a behavioural reflex,
- and a relational posture.

## Why Schemas exist

Schemas are how you avoid shallow “skills only” recovery.

Because two people can learn the same skill…

and one still relapses.

Why?

Different maintaining models.

Different predictions.

Schemas let you:

- predict relapse patterns
- choose the right intervention tone
- build long-term identity recovery

## Schema rule (locked)

A schema must be:

- stable over time
- broadly predictive
- and explainable in plain language

If it’s too specific, it’s a mindblock.

If it’s too vague, it’s a pillar.

## Schema outputs (must have)

Each schema must have:

- core maintaining belief(s)
- core threat/need signature
- typical coping patterns (Families)
- typical mindblock templates
- “green state” signature (what recovery looks like inside that schema)

You already have the scaffold for schema evidence and schema targeting in your system planning.

---

# Layer 5: Family

## What it is

A Family is an **expression cluster** of a Schema.

It’s how the schema shows up “on the street.”

Families answer:

> “How does this schema behave in real life?”
> 

## Why Families exist

Because schemas are too broad for precise targeting.

And mindblocks are too small to organize without structure.

Families are the “pattern bundles” therapists recognize:

- reassurance loops
- avoidance clusters
- overcontrol clusters
- collapse clusters
- performative safety clusters

This layer is the bridge between:

- the maintaining model (schema)
    
    and
    
- the atomic targets (mindblocks)

## Family rule (locked)

Every schema must have families across the main coping styles:

1. Surrender / collapse
2. Avoidance / numb / withdraw
3. Overcompensation / control / attack
4. Safety behaviours (subtle avoidance)
5. Recovery-specific “relief shortcuts” (addiction loop capture)

This prevents drift.

It also makes your “2,847 mindblocks” claim plausible, because you’re generating mindblocks from finite patterns, not brainstorming forever.

## Family outputs (must have)

Each family must specify:

- the default “move” the person makes
- the short-term payoff
- the long-term cost
- the most common mindblock templates
- best primitives to interrupt it
- best proof artifacts

Your schema already anticipates families linking to interventions, claims, lenses — meaning families were always intended to be operational.

---

# Layer 6: Mindblock

## What it is

A Mindblock is the **atomic unit**.

It’s not a topic.

It’s not a mantra.

It’s not an affirmation.

A mindblock is a **mini predictive rule** that hijacks choice.

Mindblocks answer:

> “What exact sentence-level prediction locks behaviour in place?”
> 

## The mindblock format (locked)

A mindblock must be representable as:

- Trigger context
- Prediction (threat/need)
- Body impulse
- Automatic move
- Short-term payoff
- Long-term cost
- Replacement truth
- Replacement move
- Proof/transfer test

If a candidate can’t be expressed like this, it’s not atomic enough.

## Why mindblocks exist

Because the brain doesn’t change at the level of “concepts.”

It changes through:

- micro-decisions,
- repeated under load,
- reinforced through proof.

Mindblocks give you:

- target precision
- auditability
- personalization
- measurement

And crucially:

Mindblocks are the only level that can be reliably “green” or “not green.”

## Mindblock outputs (must have)

Every mindblock must specify:

- best primitive (one primary)
- best voice stance (to reduce threat/reactance/shame)
- heat band
- KBE stage target (what stage this intervention is trying to shift)
- proof artifacts and transfer tests (what counts as “embodying”)

Your blueprint and system notes already define KBE and proof as the installation logic that turns mindblocks into identity.

---

# The whole stack as a single sentence

**Pillars define what we rebuild. Concepts define what system is moving. Themes define what we practice. Schemas define what keeps the loop alive. Families define how it shows up. Mindblocks define what we target and prove until it becomes identity.**

That’s the difference between:

- a content company
    
    and
    
- a recovery operating system.

## 3) The installation pathway

### Problem → Green, Embodied Mindblock (INTENSE DETAIL)

This is the most important section in the whole skyscraper, because it explains **how change actually gets installed**.

Not “what we believe.”

Not “what we teach.”

**How a human moves from a real-world problem to a new default under load.**

This is the engine.

---

# The Core Principle

### The problem is not the behaviour.

The problem is the **prediction** driving the behaviour.

People don’t “choose relapse.”

They choose:

- relief,
- safety,
- belonging,
- control,
- or numbness

…because the nervous system predicts:

> “If I don’t do this, something worse will happen.”
> 

So the pathway is about changing:

1. **state**
2. **prediction**
3. **move**
4. **identity**

In that order.

---

# The Pathway in 9 Steps (conference-ready)

## Step 1 — Capture the presenting problem

This is the “moment on the street.”

We capture:

- what happened
- where/when
- who was there
- what the person did
- what it cost
- and what it *meant*

A therapist never starts with “fix.”

They start with **phenomenology**: what is the lived experience?

This matters because:

- the system needs a clear, bounded episode
- and it needs language from the person, not theory language

Deliverable (human):

A crisp description of the loop.

Deliverable (system):

A structured “episode” object (even if implicit at first): trigger → response → outcome.

---

## Step 2 — Heat gate (biological readiness)

This is your foundational law:

**If arousal is high, cognition is not available.**

So we don’t ask for insight while the system is on fire.

This is the difference between:

- content platforms (always teach)
- your platform (teach only when the system can encode)

So the first question is not:

> “What should we tell them?”
> 

It’s:

> “Are they in a state where learning can land?”
> 

### Heat bands (locked framing)

- **Red**: high arousal / threat mode / impulsivity likely
    
    Goal: *stabilize and prevent harm.*
    
- **Amber**: activated but reachable
    
    Goal: *pattern naming + one move.*
    
- **Green**: settled enough to integrate
    
    Goal: *meaning, identity, transfer.*
    

**Heat decides the category of intervention.**

Not preference. Not vibe.

Deliverable:

A state constraint. A readiness constraint.

This is the gating layer that makes your “installation vs information” claim real.

---

## Step 3 — Backstory mapping (therapist’s first move)

Before a therapist targets a mindblock, they map the loop *in time*:

- repeated triggers
- repeated relational dynamics
- repeated collapses
- repeated coping
- recurring meaning (“what this says about me”)

Importantly:

This is not “tell me your whole life.”

It’s:

> “Show me the repeating pattern that keeps returning.”
> 

### The backstory map outputs (locked)

Every backstory capture must produce:

- 3–5 recurring contexts (“hot zones”)
- 3 recurring relational loops
- 3 recurring self-statements
- 3 recurring coping moves
- 3 remembered breakthroughs (when they *did* choose differently)

Those breakthroughs matter because they are:

- early proof candidates
- early identity receipts
- early “green mindblock seeds”

This is how you turn “history” into “targets.”

---

## Step 4 — Case formulation (schema → family → mindblock hypothesis)

Now we convert the story into a working model:

1. **Schema hypothesis**
    
    What maintaining model is running?
    
    (Unsafe world, defectiveness/shame, immediate relief, abandonment, etc.)
    
2. **Family hypothesis**
    
    How does it show up?
    
    (avoidance cluster, reassurance loop, overcontrol, collapse, sabotage…)
    
3. **Mindblock candidates**
    
    What are the atomic predictions inside it?
    

Example:

- Schema: Defectiveness/Shame
- Family: Hide the real self
- Mindblock candidate: “If they see me, I’ll be rejected.”

This step creates **targets**.

Not content.

Targets.

Deliverable:

A prioritized shortlist of mindblocks (usually 3–7).

---

## Step 5 — Mechanism selection (what changes this loop)

Now we ask:

> “What mechanism, if applied here, would change the outcome?”
> 

Mechanisms are not “wisdom.”

They’re causal levers:

- downshift physiology
- increase affect labeling
- reduce cognitive fusion
- widen time horizon
- increase repair capacity
- improve choice architecture

Mechanism selection is the bridge between:

- clinical formulation
    
    and
    
- intervention delivery

Deliverable:

Mechanism chosen for *this* loop.

---

## Step 6 — Primitive selection (the shared grammar)

Now we pick the smallest move category.

This is where your Eight Primitives are non-negotiable.

Because it forces discipline:

You’re not “doing everything.”

You’re doing **one move**.

### The primitive rules (locked)

- **Red** → Orient / Downshift / Repair
- **Amber** → Name Pattern / Make Move
- **Green** → Capture Receipt / Transfer Test / Witness

You can still do others in each band, but these are the default.

Deliverable:

One primary primitive for this intervention.

This is what makes the system:

- explainable (“why this, why now”)
- auditable
- consistent across content formats

---

## Step 7 — Voice + approach selection (how it lands)

Here’s the truth therapists recognize:

Sometimes the intervention is right…

but the **tone** makes it fail.

So we separate:

- **Approach** = interaction type (mirror, probe, paradox, parts roll call, somatic scan…)
- **Voice** = stance/affect geometry (therapist, compassionate witness, paradox sage, elder, coach, etc.)

### Locked rule

Voice never changes the target.

Voice changes **access**.

Voice is chosen based on:

- shame load
- reactance
- attachment threat
- grief depth
- cognitive availability
- preference (secondary, not primary)

Deliverable:

A delivery style that can land without triggering defence.

This is why your “Council” system matters: it’s not gimmick.

It’s clinical delivery intelligence.

---

## Step 8 — Proof capture (Action → Artifact)

Now we make it real.

We don’t say:

> “Good job.”
> 

We capture a receipt.

Because proof is how the nervous system learns:

- “that worked”
- “I survived”
- “I can do it”
- “I am becoming someone new”

### Proof has to be ethical

Not surveillance.

Not coercion.

Proof is:

- self-authored
- consent-based
- meaningful to the user

Proof can be:

- a note
- a voice soundbite
- a completed practice
- a transfer test outcome
- a repaired message sent
- a craving surfed without acting

Deliverable:

A proof artifact.

This is your currency layer.

---

## Step 9 — KBE progression (installing the new default)

This is the installation engine.

### Knowing

They can name it.

They can explain it.

They recognize the loop.

### Believing

They choose it sometimes.

Especially in amber.

They begin to trust the new truth.

### Embodying (green)

They do it under load.

Repeatedly.

Across contexts.

And it holds.

**Embodying requires transfer.**

If it only works in one place, it’s not installed.

Deliverable:

A KBE shift (tracked by artifacts + transfer tests).

---

# What “Green, Embodied Mindblock” means (locked definition)

A mindblock is “green” when:

1. The replacement move occurs under real load
2. It occurs across multiple contexts
3. It produces receipts
4. It survives rupture (they repair instead of collapse)
5. The person begins to narrate it as identity (“I do this now”)

**Green = default under load, not agreement in calm.**

That sentence alone will land in any therapy conference.

---

# The pathway as one line (for slides)

**Problem → Heat gate → Story map → Formulation → Mechanism → Primitive → Voice → Proof → KBE → Embodied Mindblock**

That’s the installation engine.

### Proof/Transfer is part of the pathway

Step 8–9 stays non-negotiable: **receipt + transfer** are how Believing becomes Embodying. If we can’t capture it, we can’t claim it.

## 4) The mechanisms library

### What we change, why it works, how it works, and how we prove it (INTENSE DETAIL)

This section is the “neuroscientist + clinician handshake.”

Because mechanisms are the bridge between:

- *theory* (what’s happening)
    
    and
    
- *delivery* (what we do)
    
    and
    
- *proof* (how we know it worked)

If this library is locked, everything downstream becomes deterministic:

- schemas → families → mindblocks
- navicues and journeys
- proof types
- voice routing
- MTTR optimization

---

# 4.1 The Core Rule

### We do not deliver content.

We deliver mechanisms.

Content is just the packaging.

The mechanism is the active ingredient.

So every intervention in the system must be able to answer:

1. **What mechanism is this targeting?**
2. **Why does that mechanism matter for recovery?**
3. **What changes when the mechanism shifts?**
4. **What do we expect to observe if it worked?**
5. **What proof artifact can we capture?**
6. **When should we NOT use it (contraindications)?**

This is the difference between:

- “therapeutic vibes”
    
    and
    
- an installable clinical system.

---

# 4.2 The Recoverlution Mechanism Card (canonical format)

Every mechanism becomes a “card” with a fixed schema (in human language).

### Mechanism Card Template (locked)

**Name**

**What it’s for (problem signature)**

**What it changes (system/process)**

**Why it works (jargon-light rationale)**

**Best heat band** (red / amber / green)

**Best primitive** (one primary)

**Best approaches** (mirror/probe/paradox/parts/somatic/transfer…)

**Best voice stances** (therapist / witness / paradox / coach / elder…)

**Outputs** (what the user can do/say)

**Proof artifacts** (what counts as evidence)

**Transfer tests** (how we prove it generalizes)

**Contraindications** (when not to push)

**Common failure modes** (how it breaks)

**Repair move** (what to do when it breaks)

This card format is what lets the Algorithm Visualizer say “technical accuracy without overwhelm” because every mechanism is packaged consistently.

---

# 4.3 The “Mechanism Families” (the master set)

Below is the complete library you need to cover your six pillars without gaps.

I’m not listing “frameworks” (CBT/DBT/ACT/MI).

I’m listing **mechanism families** that those frameworks implement.

Because you’re building the meta-platform.

---

## A) State Regulation Mechanisms (foundational gating)

These determine whether anything else is even possible.

### 1) Arousal downshift

- **What it’s for:** high heat, panic, impulsive escalation, craving spikes
- **What it changes:** sympathetic dominance → parasympathetic engagement; restores access to cognition
- **Best heat:** red → amber
- **Best primitive:** Downshift
- **Proof artifacts:** “returned to baseline” marker, breath completed, urge reduced, timer completed
- **Transfer tests:** “can downshift within 2 minutes in two different environments”
- **Contraindications:** using downshift to avoid necessary action (“spiritual bypassing”); dissociation risk—prefer orienting first

### 2) Orienting and safety calibration

- **What it’s for:** dissociation, overwhelm, “not here,” panic spirals
- **What it changes:** attention returns to present cues; reduces threat ambiguity
- **Best heat:** red
- **Best primitive:** Orient
- **Proof:** “3 true things,” location confirmation, grounding check-ins
- **Transfer:** repeat in multiple contexts

### 3) Interoceptive awareness (body mapping)

- **What it’s for:** numbness, alexithymia, “I don’t know what I feel”
- **What it changes:** sensation → emotion meaning pipeline becomes visible
- **Best heat:** amber/green (sometimes red with guidance)
- **Best primitive:** Name Pattern (after Downshift)
- **Proof:** body map entry, named sensation + emotion, reduced confusion
- **Contraindications:** trauma flooding—must gate by heat

**Why these are foundational:**

Because without state stability, you cannot “install” anything; you can only stimulate more cognition that doesn’t encode.

---

## B) Cognitive Flexibility Mechanisms (meaning layer)

These change the interpretation that drives emotion and behaviour.

### 4) Affect labeling / emotion granularity

- **What it’s for:** emotional overwhelm, shame fog, confusion
- **What it changes:** shifts limbic activation into a regulated naming network; increases sense-making
- **Best heat:** amber
- **Best primitive:** Name Pattern
- **Proof:** “I’m feeling X, not Y” + intensity rating change
- **Transfer:** label successfully in two distinct triggers

### 5) Reappraisal (meaning shift)

- **What it’s for:** threat appraisals, catastrophic meaning, hopelessness
- **What it changes:** interpretation → emotion intensity → action tendency
- **Best heat:** green/amber (not red)
- **Best primitive:** Name Pattern → Make Move
- **Proof:** new frame chosen + different action taken
- **Transfer:** frame used under moderate load, later under higher load

### 6) Defusion / decentering

- **What it’s for:** thought entanglement (“I must obey this thought”)
- **What it changes:** reduces cognitive fusion; thoughts become events not commands
- **Best heat:** amber/green
- **Best primitive:** Name Pattern
- **Proof:** “I notice I’m having the thought…” + behaviour shift
- **Contra:** avoid using it to invalidate emotion (“just thoughts”)—pair with compassion

**Why these matter for recovery:**

Because relapse loops are often maintained by rigid interpretations and fused commands under stress.

---

## C) Learning & Consolidation Mechanisms (installation engine)

This is the most ignored category in treatment systems — and it’s where you win.

### 7) Reinforcement through proof (receipt capture)

- **What it’s for:** making change stick, building self-efficacy, preventing “it didn’t count”
- **What it changes:** evidence accumulation; identity confirmation; reward re-association with recovery actions
- **Best heat:** green
- **Best primitive:** Capture Receipt
- **Proof:** the artifact *is* the mechanism output
- **Transfer:** receipts across contexts and days (not one-time)

### 8) Transfer testing (generalization)

- **What it’s for:** avoiding “it only works in session”
- **What it changes:** moves from state-dependent learning → robust learning
- **Best heat:** green/amber
- **Best primitive:** Transfer Test
- **Proof:** successful execution in a new context
- **Contra:** too early = failure and shame; must be staged

### 9) Repair as learning (rupture → return)

- **What it’s for:** slips, breaks, relational ruptures, shame spirals
- **What it changes:** converts rupture into skill; prevents “collapse after imperfection”
- **Best heat:** amber/green
- **Best primitive:** Repair
- **Proof:** repair action taken + reduced avoidance
- **Transfer:** repair in self + repair in relationship

**Why this is the installation engine:**

Because KBE to Embodiment requires consolidation and generalization. Without these, you get “Knowing” forever.

---

## D) Decision & Habit Mechanisms (behaviour under load)

This is where relapse actually happens.

### 10) Time horizon expansion

- **What it’s for:** “I need it now,” discounting the future
- **What it changes:** delay discounting; future self continuity; choice quality
- **Best heat:** amber/green
- **Best primitive:** Make Move (after Name Pattern)
- **Proof:** “play the tape” executed + alternative chosen
- **Transfer:** used in two craving windows

### 11) Friction and choice architecture

- **What it’s for:** automaticity, impulsive access
- **What it changes:** environment → behaviour likelihood; reduces reliance on willpower
- **Best heat:** green (design in calm)
- **Best primitive:** Make Move
- **Proof:** barrier installed; plan enacted
- **Transfer:** holds over time (7–14 days)

### 12) Implementation intentions (if–then)

- **What it’s for:** predictable triggers; failure to act in the moment
- **What it changes:** cue → action becomes automatic
- **Best heat:** green
- **Best primitive:** Make Move → Transfer Test
- **Proof:** if–then executed during trigger
- **Contra:** too complex plans fail; must be small

---

## E) Social Safety Mechanisms (relapse prevention through connection)

These reduce isolation-driven relapse and improve regulation via co-regulation.

### 13) Co-regulation

- **What it’s for:** high stress states; loneliness; dysregulation
- **What it changes:** nervous system stabilizes in relationship
- **Best heat:** red/amber
- **Best primitive:** Downshift / Witness
- **Proof:** reached out + returned faster
- **Transfer:** reaching out becomes default under load

### 14) Rupture and repair scripts

- **What it’s for:** conflict avoidance, isolation loops
- **What it changes:** relational safety + trust
- **Best heat:** green/amber
- **Best primitive:** Repair
- **Proof:** message sent / conversation held
- **Transfer:** repair used in a second relationship

### 15) Boundary setting

- **What it’s for:** approval-seeking, enmeshment, resentment
- **What it changes:** reduces chronic stress; increases self-direction
- **Best heat:** green
- **Best primitive:** Make Move
- **Proof:** boundary communicated
- **Contra:** safety risk—must assess context

---

## F) Identity Mechanisms (the “green lock” layer)

These turn skills into “who I am.”

### 16) Values alignment

- **What it’s for:** drift, meaning collapse, “why bother”
- **What it changes:** motivation quality; coherence; long-term persistence
- **Best heat:** green
- **Best primitive:** Witness → Make Move
- **Proof:** values chosen + small action aligned
- **Transfer:** values action under moderate stress

### 17) Self-compassion / shame repair

- **What it’s for:** self-punishment, relapse spiral, worthlessness
- **What it changes:** shame threat reduces; allows repair; prevents identity collapse
- **Best heat:** amber/green
- **Best primitive:** Repair / Witness
- **Proof:** kinder self-talk + repair action taken

### 18) Narrative integration

- **What it’s for:** split self, “I’m broken,” “I’m only my past”
- **What it changes:** story coherence; reduces fragmentation; stabilizes identity
- **Best heat:** green
- **Best primitive:** Witness
- **Proof:** new story statement + consistent action

# 4.4 How mechanisms map to the Eight Primitives (locked table)

This is how you keep the whole platform coherent.

- **Orient** → safety calibration, present anchoring, dissociation recovery
- **Downshift** → arousal regulation, co-regulation entry, panic containment
- **Name Pattern** → affect labeling, distortion spotting, schema recognition, defusion
- **Make Move** → boundaries, if–then, friction installs, values-based action
- **Capture Receipt** → proof artifacts, identity receipts, self-efficacy reinforcement
- **Transfer Test** → generalization, context robustness
- **Repair** → rupture recovery, slip recovery, shame spiral interruption
- **Witness** → identity consolidation, narrative integration, meaning anchoring

Every mechanism has a primary primitive so routing stays explainable.

---

# 4.5 Mechanisms must have Proof + Transfer Tests (non-negotiable)

If you want Embodiment, you must have:

- **receipt** (proof it happened)
- **transfer** (proof it holds elsewhere)
- **repair** (proof it survives rupture)

That’s the installation triad.

Without it you get: Knowing without Embodying.

---

# 4.6 What this section locks (so we can generate mindblocks)

When we generate mindblocks, each one will be attached to:

- a primary mechanism family
- a primary primitive
- a default heat band
- a default KBE target
- approved proof artifacts and transfer tests

That means mindblock creation becomes:

- structured
- governable
- scalable

Not poetry.

### Mechanism cards must include proof

Every mechanism card must declare: best heat band, primary primitive, **receipt types**, and **transfer tests**. Mechanisms without measurement are theory-only.

## 5) Voices, approaches, and the therapist’s first move (INTENSE DETAIL)

This is the layer that makes Recoverlution feel like therapy — not “wellness content.”

It’s also the layer that stops your platform from becoming:

- generic
- preachy
- triggering
- or too “guru-coded” for clinical rooms

Because in real therapy, **the intervention is often correct**, but the *delivery* is wrong.

So we lock this as a formal system.

---

# 5.1 The therapist’s first move (what happens before skills)

A therapist does not start with:

- protocols
- exercises
- education

They start with **attunement + formulation**.

Meaning:

1. “Help me understand your world.”
2. “What’s the loop?”
3. “What does it mean to you?”
4. “What’s the smallest change that would matter?”

Your .md calls this out explicitly via intake/formulation structures (story map entries, notes, case formulation objects) and your design intent that the user’s lived experience becomes part of the engine.

### The platform translation (locked)

Before we target mindblocks, we capture:

**A) Introspection**

- “What do you notice?”
- “What do you feel in your body?”
- “What thought keeps returning?”

**B) Insight**

- “What pattern do you see?”
- “What do you think you’re protecting?”
- “What do you fear would happen if you didn’t do the old move?”

**C) Struggle**

- “What’s hardest?”
- “What do you keep failing at?”
- “Where do you collapse?”

**D) Breakthrough**

- “When did you choose differently?”
- “What worked even once?”
- “What’s a moment you’re proud of?”

These four buckets are your backstory map.

They’re also the raw material for:

- schema hypotheses
- family clustering
- mindblock seeds
- and identity receipts

### Why this must be first-class

Because the first “green mindblock” is rarely delivered by a guru.

It’s delivered by the person hearing themselves.

That’s the Witness function, early.

---

# 5.2 Three distinct layers (the separation that prevents chaos)

You must **separate these forever**:

## A) Approach (interaction type)

This is what kind of therapeutic move is being performed.

Examples (you’ve already been using these):

- **Statement mirror**
- **Belief probe**
- **Paradox / koan prompt**
- **Parts roll call**
- **Somatic scan**
- **Transfer test prompt**
- **Repair script**
- **Witness reflection**

Approaches are the *shape of the intervention*.

## B) Voice (stance / affect geometry)

Voice is how it lands.

Voice is not “content.”

It’s not “tone.”

It’s a therapeutic stance.

## C) Mechanism (active ingredient)

Mechanism is what changes.

Locked rule:

- **Mechanism is the medicine**
- **Approach is the delivery method**
- **Voice is the bedside manner**

If you confuse these, you get “scrappy.”

---

# 5.3 The Voice Taxonomy (v1.0 locked set)

You asked: therapeutic voices we have.

You also referenced “guru/architectural tones.”

So instead of naming personalities, we lock to **archetypal clinical stances**.

Because at a conference, you can say:

“We deliver the same mechanism through different stances to reduce reactance and shame.”

That gets respect.

### Voice archetypes (conference-legible)

1. **Clinician (Attuned Therapist)**
- stance: warm, grounded, direct
- function: clarity + safety
- best for: shame, grief, confusion, high attachment threat
- risk: can trigger reactance in defiance schemas if too directive
1. **Compassionate Witness**
- stance: validating, non-fixing
- function: reduce shame, increase self-acceptance, allow repair
- best for: self-punishment, defectiveness, relapse spirals
- risk: can feel “soft” to highly controlling people; pair with Make Move later
1. **Coach (Agency Builder)**
- stance: energizing, action-oriented, structured
- function: commitment, follow-through, behavioural momentum
- best for: helplessness/powerlessness, inertia, routine building
- risk: can trigger shame if used too early after a slip
1. **Sage (Perspective Shifter)**
- stance: spacious, meaning-making, reframe-friendly
- function: time horizon, narrative integration
- best for: doom bias, immediate relief loops, existential drift
- risk: can be bypassing if heat is high (needs green readiness)
1. **Paradox (Koan / Pattern Breaker)**
- stance: playful, disruptive, non-linear
- function: breaks rigid cognition, reduces fusion, flips certainty
- best for: overcontrol/perfection, rumination engines, stuckness
- risk: can feel unsafe in high shame; gate by safety
1. **Nurturer (Co-regulator)**
- stance: soothing, sensory, embodied
- function: downshift, containment, body-based safety
- best for: panic, craving spikes, nervous system overwhelm
- risk: can become dependency if used without skill-building progression
1. **Straight Talk (Reality Anchor)**
- stance: honest, bounded, no enabling
- function: interrupt denial, bring orientation to consequences
- best for: immediate relief rationalizations, relapse minimization
- risk: triggers reactance if not paired with empathy
1. **Elder (Integrity / Values)**
- stance: steady, dignified, identity-forward
- function: values alignment, self-respect, long game
- best for: identity integration, relapse repair, future self
- risk: can feel abstract without an immediate “Make Move”

### The key point

These are not “styles.”

They are **clinical delivery stances**.

And they become a routing dimension:

- selected by state (heat)
- selected by schema risk (reactance/shame)
- selected by KBE stage

---

# 5.4 Voice gating rules (when to use which voice)

This is the part that makes it feel safe and smart.

## Heat gating (default rules)

- **Red:** Nurturer / Clinician / Witness
    
    Goal: downshift + safety + containment.
    
- **Amber:** Clinician / Coach / Paradox (careful)
    
    Goal: name pattern + one move.
    
- **Green:** Sage / Elder / Coach / Witness
    
    Goal: meaning + integration + transfer + identity.
    

## Schema gating (example rules)

- **Reactance/Defiance:** avoid Straight Talk too early; use Paradox + autonomy language
- **Defectiveness/Shame:** avoid Coach first; use Witness + Clinician + repair emphasis
- **Control/Perfection:** Paradox is powerful; pair with “small imperfect action”
- **Immediate Relief:** Straight Talk can work *after* Witness; then tape-forward + friction move
- **Abandonment:** use Clinician/Witness tone; emphasize co-regulation and repair

---

# 5.5 Approaches taxonomy (v1.0 locked set)

This is the “move library” — independent of voice.

### Core approaches (high leverage)

1. **Statement Mirror**
- “Here’s what I’m hearing you say…”
- function: bring implicit belief into explicit language
- best primitive: Name Pattern
- best KBE: Knowing → Believing
1. **Belief Probe**
- “If that were true, what would it mean about you?”
- function: expose the schema prediction
- best primitive: Name Pattern
- best KBE: Knowing (then Believing if it lands)
1. **Somatic Scan**
- “Where do you feel this in your body?”
- function: interoception + arousal awareness
- best primitive: Orient/Downshift
- best KBE: Knowing
1. **Paradox Prompt / Koan**
- “What if the thing you’re chasing is what’s trapping you?”
- function: disrupt rigid cognition
- best primitive: Name Pattern
- best KBE: Believing shift
1. **Make-One-Move**
- “What is the smallest action you can take in the next 60 seconds?”
- function: behavioural pivot
- best primitive: Make Move
- best KBE: Believing → Embodying
1. **Receipt Capture**
- “Record what you did and what changed.”
- function: reinforcement + identity
- best primitive: Capture Receipt
- best KBE: Embodying
1. **Transfer Test Prompt**
- “Can you run this in a different context tomorrow?”
- function: generalization
- best primitive: Transfer Test
- best KBE: Embodying
1. **Repair Script**
- “Name what happened, own your part, ask for what you need.”
- function: rupture recovery
- best primitive: Repair
- best KBE: Embodying
1. **Witness Reflection**
- “What does this say about who you are becoming?”
- function: identity consolidation
- best primitive: Witness
- best KBE: Embodying lock

---

# 5.6 The “Soundtrack of your life” layer (why voice receipts matter)

This is where you are genuinely different.

A therapist wants:

- the person’s own language
- their own breakthroughs
- their own *felt truth*

So your system captures:

- typed notes (introspection, insight)
- voice soundbites (struggle, breakthrough)
- and stitches them into identity reinforcement

Your Spark/Flame/Ember ontology makes this executable:

- Spark = interrupt (regulate)
- Flame = pivot (pattern shift)
- Ember = consolidate (identity warmth)

So over time, the person literally builds:

- an internal recovery soundtrack
- their own “witness tape”
- their own proof archive

This is not gimmick.

It is memory + identity installation.

---

# 5.7 What this section locks (so we can update schema later)

When we “lock voices,” we are locking:

1. a fixed list of voice archetypes (stances)
2. gating rules by heat and schema risk
3. a fixed list of approaches (interaction types)
4. mappings: approach → primitive → KBE target → proof type

So when you later say:

“Generate 2,847 mindblocks”

…every mindblock can come prewired with:

- best voice stances
- best approaches
- best primitive
- best heat band
- proof artifacts and transfer tests

That’s how the system stays coherent at scale.

## 6) Spark · Flame · Ember

### Audio ontology as mechanism delivery infrastructure (INTENSE DETAIL)

This is where Recoverlution stops being “an app with audio” and becomes **a neuroadaptive installation system**.

Because audio isn’t a content format here.

Audio is:

- **state intervention**
- **identity reinforcement**
- **proof capture**
- and **consolidation**

If you lock this correctly, your audio layer becomes the most scalable therapeutic delivery channel you have — and it integrates seamlessly with Journeys, NaviCues, and the Proof Chain.

---

# 6.1 The core claim

### Spark / Flame / Ember are not “content types.”

They are **neuropsychological functions**.

Each one corresponds to a different job in the installation pathway:

- Spark = interrupt the loop (fast state shift)
- Flame = pivot the meaning (pattern + move)
- Ember = consolidate into identity (proof + witness + narrative)

That means audio can be routed like medicine:

- not by user preference alone,
- but by heat, KBE stage, and target mechanism.

This is exactly how your system avoids becoming “more podcasts.”

---

# 6.2 The three audio states (locked definitions)

## Spark (interrupt)

### Function

Stop the runaway loop.

Create a wedge.

Restore agency.

### When it’s used

- red heat
- craving spikes
- panic spirals
- rumination escalation
- urge “I need it now” moments
- dissociation or overwhelm (paired with orienting)

### Mechanisms it delivers

- arousal downshift
- orienting and grounding
- co-regulation entry
- containment (distress tolerance)

### Primary primitives

- Orient
- Downshift

### Characteristics (what Spark audio must be)

- short
- direct
- sensory and embodied
- minimal cognitive load
- no “teaching”
- no long narrative
- no philosophical framing

### What success looks like

- time-to-baseline decreases
- the person does not escalate
- the person can access the next step (Name Pattern / Make Move)

### Proof artifacts

- “I completed the Spark”
- timer completion
- before/after intensity rating
- a single sentence “receipt” (“I didn’t act.”)

### Transfer tests

- can Spark in multiple contexts
- can Spark without headphones
- can Spark within 90 seconds of trigger onset

**Spark exists to buy the brain enough space for choice.**

---

## Flame (pivot)

### Function

Shift the meaning layer.

Name the pattern.

Choose the next right move.

### When it’s used

- amber heat
- after Spark has stabilized red
- when the person can hold attention long enough to engage cognition

### Mechanisms it delivers

- affect labeling (emotion granularity)
- defusion / decentering
- cognitive reappraisal
- pattern recognition (schema recognition)
- small action selection (implementation intention)

### Primary primitives

- Name Pattern
- Make Move

### Characteristics (what Flame audio must be)

- structured
- interactive (prompts, pauses, “say it out loud”)
- anchored in the person’s lived language
- not abstract or lecture-y
- ends with one specific action

### What success looks like

- the person can name the loop in their own words
- the person chooses a different move
- the person can explain “why that move” in one line

### Proof artifacts

- recorded “pattern name”
- short voice receipt (“here’s what I’m doing instead”)
- completed micro-action

### Transfer tests

- run Flame in a different trigger window
- run Flame after a rupture (not only in calm)
- run Flame without needing a perfect environment

**Flame is where “Knowing” becomes “Believing.”**

---

## Ember (consolidate)

### Function

Turn the new move into identity.

Warm the nervous system into safety with the new self-story.

### When it’s used

- green heat
- after a successful move
- after a repair
- after a transfer test
- during reflection windows (journey cadence)

### Mechanisms it delivers

- reinforcement through proof
- narrative integration
- self-compassion and shame repair
- values alignment
- witness function (“who I am becoming”)

### Primary primitives

- Capture Receipt
- Witness
- (often followed by Transfer Test planning)

### Characteristics (what Ember audio must be)

- slower, spacious
- reflective
- meaning-making without bypass
- personalized (ideally includes the user’s own voice)
- ends with a “witness stamp” line

### What success looks like

- the person remembers themselves as someone who can return
- the moment is stored as proof, not dismissed
- identity coherence increases (“this is who I am now”)

### Proof artifacts

- user soundbite: “this is what I did and what it meant”
- reflection note
- identity statement (new truth)
- a witnessed badge (self or professional)

### Transfer tests

- schedule a future test context
- replicate under mild stress
- replicate under real stress

**Ember is how “Believing” becomes “Embodying.”**

---

# 6.3 Spark / Flame / Ember mapped to KBE (locked)

This is crucial because it makes the audio ontology legible as an installation system:

- Spark → protects the nervous system so Knowing can happen
- Flame → creates Believing through pattern shift + action
- Ember → creates Embodying through proof + identity consolidation

This also means:

you can show “KBE gradients” over time in the Visualizer, and audio isn’t just “media,” it’s part of the learning engine.

---

# 6.4 Spark / Flame / Ember mapped to delivery surfaces

## NaviCues

- Spark = emergency micro-interventions (state rescue)
- Flame = in-moment reframe + move prompts
- Ember = post-move consolidation prompts (“capture receipt”)

## Journeys (ERA cadence)

Journeys naturally map to Ember:

- Experience → Flame moments inside week
- Recognise/Reflect → Ember reflection
- Align/Anchor → Ember + transfer test plan

That’s how weekly journeys become identity formation, not “course completion.”

---

# 6.5 The “soundtrack of your life” is not poetic — it’s clinical infrastructure

You’re right to frame it as:

“listen to the soundtrack of your lives.”

Because audio has a unique property:

- it bypasses cognitive resistance
- it reaches state quickly
- it stores memory differently than text
- it can become a ritual of return

But the killer feature is:

**the user’s own voice becomes the reinforcement loop.**

That is what turns Ember into a self-authored identity archive:

- their own truth
- in their own voice
- anchored to real proof

So the “audio system” becomes:

- the proof archive you can feel
- the witness tape
- the embodiment soundtrack

That is profoundly differentiating.

---

# 6.6 The “Affective Compiler” (why this belongs in the theoretical architecture)

This is the cleanest way to describe it in a conference room:

### The Affective Compiler

A system that takes:

- state signals (heat)
- target mindblock
- chosen mechanism + primitive
- voice stance
- and the user’s own story fragments

…and compiles them into:

- a Spark / Flame / Ember experience
    
    that installs change and captures proof.
    

Audio is the output channel.

The compiler is the engine.

This is how you can talk about it without sounding like a meditation app.

---

# 6.7 What we lock in v1.0 (so audio stays coherent forever)

1. Spark/Flame/Ember are **functional** classifications, not creative labels
2. Each has:
    - best heat band
    - best primitives
    - best voices
    - proof artifacts
    - transfer tests
3. Every audio asset must declare its type (spark/flame/ember) and its mechanism card fields
4. The user’s soundbites are always treated as:
    - proof artifacts
    - and identity reinforcement
        
        not “content uploads”
        

This makes audio part of the clinical engine, not an add-on.

## 7) What becomes final in v1.0

### The frozen vocabulary + routing rules + entry flow (INTENSE DETAIL)

This is the “pour the concrete” section.

Because once you say “this is locked,” you are making a promise:

- to clinicians (it won’t drift)
- to neuroscientists (it’s mechanism-consistent)
- to engineers (it’s enumerable + routable)
- to users (it won’t gaslight them next month)

So we freeze the **minimum set of things that must never be ambiguous**.

Not everything.

Just the foundations.

---

# 7.1 The v1.0 Freeze List (what is locked)

## A) The Vocabulary (the nouns)

These are the objects your platform thinks in.

### 1) The 6 clinical Pillars — locked

They are capacity domains.

They do not change because trends change.

- Emotional Regulation
- Stress Resilience
- Social Connectivity
- Cognitive Reframing
- Identity Integration
- Decision Mastery

Rule: **No new clinical pillar** without a major theoretical version bump.

### 2) Concepts — locked as a controlled dictionary

Concepts are mechanism clusters.

Rule: **Concepts must be research-construct-legible**.

No vibes. No marketing. No content categories.

Acceptance test:

- a neuroscientist can hear the concept name and know what system you’re talking about
- a clinician can map it to an intervention pathway
- an engineer can route with it

### 3) Themes — locked as mechanism-of-change skill families

Themes are trainable skills. Repeatable. Measurable.

Rule: **Themes are actions and capacities — not topics**.

Acceptance test:

- can be trained in <10 minutes
- can be repeated daily
- can produce a proof artifact

### 4) Schemas — locked as the maintaining model library

Schemas are the “deep prediction models” that keep loops alive.

Rule: **Schemas are a finite library**.

They’re not tags. They’re not mood labels.

Acceptance test:

- stable over time
- broadly predictive
- explainable in plain language
- yields predictable family patterns

### 5) Families — locked as expression clusters

Families are “how the schema shows up in real life.”

Rule: **Families are defined by coping direction** (not by content format).

Minimum coping directions per schema (you already agreed):

- surrender/collapse
- avoidance/numb/withdraw
- overcompensation/control/attack
- safety behaviours (subtle avoidance)
- relief-shortcuts (recovery-specific capture)

Acceptance test:

- a therapist can identify a family in session from behavior + language
- a user can recognize it as “yes, that’s my move”

### 6) Mindblocks — locked as atomic endpoints

Mindblocks are the smallest unit that can be targeted and proven.

Rule: **Mindblocks are prediction rules**:

“When X, I predict Y, so I do Z.”

Acceptance test:

- can be stated in one sentence
- observable in language and/or behavior
- has one best-fit primitive
- has receipts + transfer tests

---

## B) The Interaction Grammar (the verbs)

These are the things the system *does*.

### 7) The Eight Primitives — locked

This is your shared grammar across all pillars, all voices, all content.

- Orient
- Downshift
- Name Pattern
- Make Move
- Capture Receipt
- Transfer Test
- Repair
- Witness

Rule: **No new primitive** without a major version bump.

Because primitives are the operating system.

Acceptance test:

- every intervention can be expressed as one primary primitive
- you can explain “why this, why now” using only primitives + heat + target

---

## C) The Learning Engine (the progression)

### 8) KBE — locked

Knowing → Believing → Embodying is your installation model.

Rule: **Every intervention declares which KBE shift it is attempting.**

Acceptance test:

- Knowing shows up as recognition and naming
- Believing shows up as choice under moderate load
- Embodying shows up as repeatable behavior under real load + transfer

---

## D) The Evidence System (how you know)

### 9) Proof Chain — locked as the ethical currency model

Action → Artifact → Score/Trajectory is your measurement philosophy.

Rule: **No proof without consent. No measurement without meaning.**

Acceptance test:

- every “green” claim has artifacts
- every artifact is attributable to a mechanism + mindblock + context
- transfer tests exist for embodiment claims
- repair artifacts exist for relapse/rupture claims

---

## E) Voice + Approach (how it lands)

### 10) Voice archetypes — locked as stances

Voices are stances. Delivery geometry.

Rule: **Voice never changes the target. Voice changes access.**

Acceptance test:

- voice selection is explainable (shame, reactance, attachment threat, heat)
- users can rotate voices without changing the therapeutic intent

### 11) Approaches — locked as interaction types

Mirror. Probe. Paradox. Somatic scan. Transfer prompt. Repair script. Witness reflection.

Rule: **Approach is the shape. Voice is the stance. Mechanism is the medicine.**

Acceptance test:

- for a given mindblock, you can swap voices while keeping approach + target stable
- for a given mechanism, you can choose different approaches while keeping mechanism stable

---

## F) Audio ontology

### 12) Spark/Flame/Ember — locked as functional classes

Spark = interrupt

Flame = pivot

Ember = consolidate

Rule: **Audio assets declare their function, not their vibe.**

Acceptance test:

- Spark can reduce heat fast
- Flame ends with a move
- Ember ends with a receipt + witness stamp

---

# 7.2 The Entry Flow (what gets locked about “how a therapist starts”)

This is critical because it prevents the platform from feeling “content-first.”

### The locked intake sequence

1. Presenting problem (episode)
2. Heat band (readiness)
3. Story map (pattern signatures)
4. Case formulation snapshot:
    - schema hypothesis
    - family hypothesis
    - mindblock candidates
5. First mechanism + primitive
6. First proof artifact
7. First transfer plan (even if small)

Rule: **No deep cognitive work at red heat.**

Regulate → then reframe → then action → then proof.

Acceptance test:

- a therapist can recognize this as “yes, that’s how we work”
- a user feels seen before being coached

---

# 7.3 Governance (how “locked” stays locked)

If you don’t define governance, “final” becomes “temporary.”

### The taxonomy change rules (v1.0)

- **Pillars:** frozen (major version bump required)
- **Primitives:** frozen (major version bump required)
- **KBE:** frozen (major version bump required)
- **Schemas:** controlled (rare additions; mostly naming alignment)
- **Concepts/Themes:** controlled (can expand, but only with rules)
- **Families/Mindblocks:** expandable (this is where scale happens)

### The “no drift” tests (must pass to add anything)

Any new node must have:

1. a one-line definition
2. parent assignment (where it sits)
3. a mechanism mapping
4. a primary primitive
5. a KBE intent
6. proof artifact types
7. transfer test idea
8. contraindications (where it could harm)

If it can’t pass those, it’s not a node.

It’s a note.

---

# 7.4 Versioning (so you can evolve without breaking trust)

This matters for both:

- clinical trust (“you didn’t move the goalposts”)
- data integrity (“old artifacts still map correctly”)

### Versioning rules (v1.0)

- Every node has a **stable ID** and a **display label**
- Labels can evolve; IDs do not
- Deprecation never deletes meaning:
    - deprecated nodes map forward to successor nodes
    - historical proofs remain valid

### “Lock levels”

- LOCKED: pillars, primitives, KBE, Spark/Flame/Ember definitions
- CONTROLLED: concepts, themes, schemas
- EXPANDABLE: families, mindblocks, voice variants, approach variants

That’s how a skyscraper grows without cracking.

---

# 7.5 What this enables immediately

Once 7.0 is frozen, you can do the next steps with total confidence:

- canonical schema list + definitions
- schema → family expansion
- family → mindblock generation
- mindblock → primitive/voice/heat/KBE/proof wiring
- then sync journeys + navicues to targets

And the Visualizer becomes honest:

because every layer has rules.

### Freeze the measurement dictionaries

Capabilities, life domains, receipt types, and transfer tests are **controlled dictionaries**. Labels can evolve. IDs don’t.

## 8) How this plugs into the platform you already have

### Journeys · NaviCues · LUMA · Proof — without changing the worldview (INTENSE DETAIL)

You don’t need a new philosophy.

You need **a clean wiring model** so every surface is just a different “delivery angle” on the same installation engine.

So here’s the canonical integration layer.

# 8.1 The platform is four surfaces, one engine

### The engine (unchanged)

**Heat → Target → Mechanism → Primitive → Voice → Proof → Transfer → KBE → MTTR**

### The four delivery surfaces

1. **Journeys** = weekly installation cycles (ERA cadence)
2. **NaviCues** = moment-level steering (JITAI feed)
3. **LUMA** = orchestration + explainability (inputs → processing → outputs)
4. **Proof system** = outcomes as currency (action → artifact → chain → score → trajectory)

This framing is already explicitly in your materials: OS/ORBIT/PROOF plus “always-on, private, personal” contextual intelligence.

---

# 8.2 Journeys are “planned installation” (ERA as the weekly spine)

You’ve already built the **structural** Journey architecture correctly.

### What Journeys already do well (in schema terms)

Your schema shows:

- a **journey_template** with pillar binding, sprint number, duration, mantra, audio voice, status
- built-in target arrays: **schema_targets[]** and **mindblock_targets[]**
- and an explicit contraindication lane: **contraindicated_mindblocks[]**

Your scenes are also not generic. They’re explicitly ERA-coded:

- scene_type includes intro/experience/recognize/align/integration + reflections/cues
- input types are constrained (text/voice/slider/binary/tap)
- and audio is classified as **spark/flame/ember** at the scene level

That means: **Journeys can become “semantic” without any new tables.**

You just need to populate targets properly.

### What Journeys are missing right now

They’re structurally ready but semantically “floating”:

- they aren’t yet wired to specific schemas/families/mindblocks as stable endpoints

### What Journeys should mean in the engine

A Journey is not “education.”

A Journey is a **weekly mechanism program**:

- Experience = state + exposure + felt shift
- Recognise = pattern naming + insight
- Align = one real-world move
- Integration/Replay = proof + witness + transfer plan

That exact cadence is already written into your pillar theses (“ERA integration: how a week feels”) and blueprint.

So Journeys become:

- the **planned** pathway to KBE progression
- the “steady drumbeat” that raises baseline and reduces spikes

---

# 8.3 NaviCues are “real-time steering” (micro-interventions that hit the street)

Your exports confirm you already have the raw fuel:

- ~3,000 NaviCues
- 6 pillar_ids used
- ~30 schema slugs
- ~16 “family” values (belief_probe, statement_mirror, curveball, practice, etc.)
- and empty fields for kbe_layer / heat_level / council_lens (which is actually good — it means we can normalize cleanly)

### The critical fix: “family” means two different things

Right now:

- **Mindblock Family** (your theoretical layer) = expression cluster under schema
- NaviCue export **family** = interaction/form factor (mirror, belief probe, curveball…)

If you keep calling both “family,” your visualizer will always be muddy because the graph lies.

**Rename in the model (conceptually):**

- NaviCue “family” → **NaviCue Form** (or “NaviCue Mode”)
- Mindblock Family stays “Family”

That one rename removes a ton of perceived scrappiness.

### What NaviCues should become in the engine

A NaviCue is:

- one target (schema/family/mindblock)
- one mechanism
- one primary primitive
- one heat band suitability
- one KBE intent
- one proof request (even tiny)

And the proof request is not optional.

Even “I didn’t act” is a receipt.

---

# 8.4 LUMA is the conductor (explainable orchestration, not recommendation)

Your own doc nails this:

Inputs include:

- state signals
- context (individual/professional/org)
- taxonomy (pillar/schema/family/concept/theme/mindblock)
- proof history
- consent rules

Outputs include:

- NaviCue now
- Block/Insight learn
- Practice do
- Wellbeing video regulate/prime
- Toolkit injection save/reuse
- Repair move (relationship or system)

That’s the “Inputs → Processing → Outputs” diagram you want to show in the Visualizer.

### The LUMA decision object (what must exist, conceptually)

Every LUMA choice should be representable as:

- **Why now?** (heat/context trigger)
- **Why this?** (target + mechanism)
- **Why this voice?** (shame/reactance/attachment)
- **What do we expect to change?**
- **How will we measure it?**
- **What’s the safe alternative if declined?**

You already have a schema lane that looks built for exactly this: **kernel_decision_log** with chosen_type, chosen_id, rationale, expected_effect, measurement_contract, deployment_refs, and decision source.
Schema as of Jan 6th 2e05a0fd01…

So again: the database is ahead of the content.

---

# 8.5 Proof is not “analytics” — it’s currency

Your documents explicitly position “Outcomes as Currency” and “Impact is the ledger,” and treat blocks as promises that can be verified.

### The canonical proof loop

**Action → Artifact → Chain → Score → Trajectory**

The important part for wiring:

- Journeys generate *scheduled* artifacts (journals, reflections, align moves)
- NaviCues generate *in-the-moment* artifacts (micro-receipts)
- LUMA ensures *timing + selection + explainability*
- Proof chain converts all of it into “this is changing” without moralizing

### Your journey schema already captures proof primitives

You already have:

- **journey_scene_captures** (text, storage path, arousal snapshot, tags, luma_extracted, mindblock self-report/inferred/confidence) Schema as of Jan 6th 2e05a0fd01…
- **journey_real_world_triggers** (trigger kind/payload, mindblock challenged, transfer success) Schema as of Jan 6th 2e05a0fd01…
- **journey_resistance_checks** (value, hesitation_ms, inferred mindblocks, resistance kind) Schema as of Jan 6th 2e05a0fd01…

That is *already* a proof substrate.

It just needs endpoint definitions (mindblocks) to fully light up.

---

# 8.6 The clean mapping rules (the “wiring contract”)

This is how you make syncing journeys/navicues to schema feel inevitable.

## Rule 1 — Journeys map to Pillars + Concepts + Themes (primary)

Journeys are weekly training programs.

They should always have:

- one primary pillar
- 1–3 concepts/themes they’re training that week
- a shortlist of schemas they tend to touch

Your journey_template already binds to pillar and anticipates schema_targets[] and mindblock_targets[].
Schema as of Jan 6th 2e05a0fd01…

## Rule 2 — Schemas are the “why this keeps happening” layer (secondary)

Journeys can be “pillar-first,” but the *personalization* comes from schemas:

- LUMA sees a drift pattern and chooses which schema to address inside the journey’s week

Blueprint supports this state-matched sequencing (“regulate first… reframe when settled… end with action/co-reg”).

## Rule 3 — Families bridge to mindblocks (execution layer)

Once mindblocks exist, Families become the map that makes targeting sane.

And NaviCue “forms” (mirror/probe/curveball) become the delivery wrapper.

## Rule 4 — NaviCues should bind primarily to schema/family/mindblock (not themes)

Themes are “what we practice.”

NaviCues are “what we do right now.”

So NaviCues should target:

- one schema OR one family OR one mindblock (plus pillar for context)
    
    …and then declare:
    
- heat suitability
- primitive
- voice stance
- proof ask

Your export already has pillar + schema slug + “form” values; it’s 80% of the work.

---

# 8.7 What “syncing” actually means (the execution plan, conceptually)

You said: you haven’t finished syncing journeys/navicues to schema.

Good. Because the right order is:

### Phase A — Freeze the theoretical architecture (we just did)

Pillars → Concepts → Themes → Schemas → Families → Mindblocks.

### Phase B — Normalize classification dimensions

- Rename NaviCue “family” → NaviCue Form
- Create a canonical schema slug map so exports reconcile to schema_catalog titles (your files explicitly flag mismatch risk)

### Phase C — Define mindblocks (atomic endpoints)

Because your own schema and exports both show the same bottleneck:

If endpoints don’t exist, nothing truly maps.

### Phase D — Attach

- Journeys → schema_targets + mindblock_targets
- Journey scenes → mindblock_targets + intent fields (already present in schema)
- NaviCues → schema/family/mindblock targeting + heat/KBE/voice (fill the empty columns)

### Phase E — Let LUMA orchestrate

Once all assets declare:

- target
- heat
- primitive
- KBE intent
- proof ask
    
    …LUMA becomes explainable instead of “smart.”
    

### Wiring contract update

Add the measurement contract to every asset: target + routing + **receipt** + **transfer**. That’s what makes the engine honest at scale.

## 10) Proof of Change (the Change Layer)

If the stack gives you *precision*—this gives you **translation**.

Because mindblocks are atomic.
Humans don’t live at atomic scale.

So we roll proof up—without losing the clinical map.

### The rule

No ranking humans against humans.
No “gamified recovery”.
No coercion.

Only within-person trajectory.
Consent-native. Audit-ready.

### The ATLAS Measurement Stack (locked)

1. **State**
    
    What the nervous system is doing *now* (heat band, spike index, readiness).
    
2. **Action**
    
    What move happened *when it mattered* (primitive + completion).
    
3. **Receipt**
    
    Evidence the action happened (time-stamped, attributable, meaningful).
    
4. **Transfer**
    
    Evidence it holds outside the app (new context, higher heat, social world).
    
5. **Trajectory**
    
    The trend over time (stability increasing, return speed improving).
    

### The scoreboard (what we show to humans)

We keep it Apple-simple:

- **Return Speed** (MTTR trendline)
- **Capabilities** (6) — how you’re becoming
- **Life Domains** (10) — where life is changing
- **Receipts + Transfer** — the ledger of proof

No leaderboards.
No comparison.
Only the path.

### Capabilities (public-facing)

- **Return Speed** — faster return after disruption
- **Choice Under Heat** — better moves while activated
- **Repair & Reconnect** — rupture → repair becomes default
- **Self-Trust** — promises kept to self (micro-reps)
- **Flexibility** — predictions update; fusion loosens
- **Forward Pull** — meaning + future self become real again

### Life Domains (relatable roll-ups)

Stability & Regulation · Cravings & Impulses · Relationships & Repair · Identity & Self-Worth ·
Work, Structure & Routine · Meaning & Future Self · Body & Health Behaviors · Cognition & Reframing ·
Environment & Exposure · Support Network & Care

### The measurement contract (non-negotiable)

Every **NaviCue** and every **Journey scene** must declare:

- Target(s): schema / family / mindblock
- Routing: heat band + KBE intent + best primitive + voice stance
- Proof: which receipt is being captured
- Transfer: how we’ll test it in the real world

If it can’t declare that, it’s not an intervention.
It’s content.

### What “green” actually means

A mindblock is green when:

- the new move happens under real load,
- across more than one context,
- with receipts,
- and survives rupture (repair replaces collapse).

Green is a *default under heat*.
Not agreement in calm.

## 11) The Willingness Gate

### Why this won’t work for everyone — and why that honesty makes it stronger

This is the part most platforms dodge.

We don’t.

Because real change has a prerequisite.

**Consent.**

**Desire.**

**Participation.**

Not perfect participation.

Not motivation cosplay.

Just a person who is *willing to try again*.

And that becomes a system rule, not a marketing line.

---

# 10.1 The non-negotiable truth

Recoverlution is not a “content library that fixes people.”

It is an **installation engine**.

Which means:

- the system can deliver the next right inch
- the system can protect attention
- the system can lower heat
- the system can scaffold repetition
- the system can prove progress

But it cannot want recovery *for* someone.

So we stop pretending.

This is **not** for everyone.

It’s for the ones who will engage with the path.

And your OS already hints at this philosophy: it’s private, adaptive, and built around eligibility and “what fits now,” not “what’s popular.”

---

# 10.2 The Readiness Contract (what we’re really measuring)

Here’s the shift:

Most systems measure “engagement.”

We measure **readiness** and **return speed**.

Your own language already sets this up:

- **State** (heat/fusion/resistance/choice + rhythm)
- **Momentum** (cadence + recovery speed)
- **Eligibility** (what intervention fits now)

So Point 10 locks a new “living signal” alongside heat:

### Resistance to change (ρ)

Not as judgement.

As physics.

Resistance is data that says:

- “this dosage is wrong”
- “this voice is wrong”
- “this target is wrong”
- or “we need a human, not a prompt”

Your .md already outlines the instrumentation for this explicitly (resistance checks, hesitation_ms, abandon events, dropoff zones).
Untitled document

---

# 10.3 The Resistance Engine (what happens when we keep hitting a wall)

This is where the platform becomes clinically serious.

If we repeatedly deliver interventions and see:

- no shift in state delta
- repeated abandon
- high hesitation
- low follow-through
- repeated relapse loop artifacts with no learning artifact

…we do not keep serving “more content.”

We **trigger an escalation protocol**.

### Escalation protocol (v1.0)

1. **Change the delivery**
    - swap voice stance
    - swap approach type
    - drop complexity (Spark before Flame)
2. **Change the target**
    - move up one level: mindblock → family → schema
    - or down one: schema → specific mindblock
3. **Invoke human support**
    - therapist nudge
    - peer check-in
    - family safety contact
4. **Invoke safety rails**
    - SOS mode
    - crisis routing paths
    - consent-bounded notifications

This is already compatible with your OS framing of orchestration and consent rules.

**Resistance is not failure.**

Resistance is a routing signal.

---

# 10.4 Humans are not optional (the augmentation stance)

Point 9 made clinicians comfortable.

Point 10 makes them relieved.

Because you’re not saying “we’re the therapist now.”

You’re saying:

**We save humans for the moments that require humans.**

Your ecosystem definition already encodes this:

- Individual generates signals + proof events
- Professionals steer with precision
- Organisations compound outcomes
- The loop strengthens all nodes

So we lock this stance:

### Recoverlution is a force multiplier

- fewer check-ins that waste session time
- more sessions focused on formulation, rupture, repair, and meaning
- less guesswork
- more continuity

That’s not anti-therapy.

That’s therapy, finally resourced.

---

# 10.5 LUMA: guiding intelligence, not open chat

You nailed this in your .md and it needs to be a public vow:

**LUMA is not “content recommendation.”**

**LUMA is moment-to-moment orchestration.**
Untitled document

So Point 10 locks the AI boundary:

### What LUMA is allowed to do

- select the next step **within the governed infrastructure**
- explain “why this, why now”
- route by state, consent, taxonomy, and proof history
- trigger escalation when resistance persists

### What LUMA is not allowed to do

- freeform therapy improvisation
- unlimited open chat with unbounded outputs
- “diagnosis” behaviour
- hallucinated certainty

This matches your governance posture (policy lifecycle, approvals, policy runs, access audit purpose binding).
Untitled document

**The magic is not that LUMA can talk.**

The magic is that LUMA can *hold the line*.

---

# 10.6 Communications, scheduling, and the “close the loop” OS

This is a missing jewel and you already have the frame for it:

Your OS “holds time, attention, and flow.”

So it should behave like an intelligent scheduler and loop-closer:

### The loop-closer pattern (universal)

- upcoming event exists (therapy session, meeting, first day back, risky night out)
- system offers:
    - **prep cue** (Spark/Flame)
    - **in-moment cue** (NaviCue)
    - **post-event capture** (Receipt + Witness)
- then it asks:
    - “Did it happen?”
    - “How did it go?”
    - “What did we learn?”
    - “What transfers next time?”

That’s not “admin.”

That’s installation.

And your measurement spine already supports this style of closed-loop capture: scene lifecycle, response contracts, resistance checks, real-world trigger proof.
Untitled document

---

# 10.7 Outside-world connectors (recovery is not inside the app)

You’re right: this has to be explicit in the architecture.

Because “transfer” is the key.

The platform must plug into the world where identity is tested:

- meetings
- peers
- movement
- sleep
- community
- accountability

Your public copy already includes “find meetings” and connected network positioning under Navigate, and an ethical integration layer.

So Point 10 locks:

### The Connector Layer

- meeting discovery (universal: not just one program)
- community events (Meetup-style surfaces)
- health and physiology streams (where consented)
- behavioural rhythm signals (sleep/movement/recovery)

But here’s the critical stance:

**We don’t turn life into surveillance.**

We turn life into context.

Signals exist to improve timing, dosage, and safety.

Not to score someone’s worth.

---

# 10.8 Data dignity (the closing vow)

This is how you end the golden 10.

### The Dignity Rule

- we do not productize personal data
- we do not rank one person against another
- we do not turn recovery into a competition
- we do not shame people with charts

Your own framework already leans this way: “private-first intelligence,” “outcomes as currency,” “auditable integrity,” and consent-native governance.

So we make it explicit:

**Data exists to return you to yourself.**

Not to turn you into a metric.

Milestones can be self-chosen.

Progress can be witnessed.

But the system never becomes a judge.

It becomes a companion infrastructure:

**anytime, anywhere, without coercion.**

---

# 10.9 Schema inputs we’ll need (so this is real, not poetic)

To make Point 10 executable, your schema (or its next migration) needs first-class support for:

1. **Resistance signals**
- resistance score events
- hesitation_ms thresholds
- “non-response” patterns
    
    (you already spec this telemetry)
    Untitled document
    
1. **Escalation protocols**
- escalation reason
- escalation target (human, peer, safety contact)
- escalation outcome
1. **Support network graph**
- who is allowed to be contacted
- for what purposes
- under what consent conditions
    
    (this fits your consent + access audit posture)
    Untitled document
    
1. **Closed-loop comms**
- notification → opened → action taken → proof captured
    
    (you already have an outbox/processor concept in ops notes)
    Untitled document
    
1. **Connector permissions**
- explicit data classification + retention
- per-integration consent scoping
    
    (this is already in your governance layer)
