# RECOVERLUTION OS — MASTER INSTALL

## 0) Category Flag
**Recovery — now runs in real life.**
A living layer that meets the moment, routes the next move, and proves it held.

## 1) Canonical Narrative (12 lines)
Recovery is not a program. It is a system.
A system that has to work when life is loud.
So we built a living layer that meets you in the moment,
routes the next right move, and helps you return.
Not once. Again. Until return becomes default.
And default becomes identity.

## 2) Operating System (irreducible loop)
**READ → ROUTE → DELIVER → SEAL**
- READ: know the moment (state, readiness, resistance).
- ROUTE: choose target + dose (family archetype, stance, proof ask).
- DELIVER: two speeds, one engine (Journeys weekly; NaviCues in-moment; LUMA conducts).
- SEAL: receipts + transfer → trajectory (proof without punishment).

**Proof stack:** Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
**North star:** MTTR — Mean Time To Return (return speed as skill).  
**Principle:** State-before-story; timing is the intervention.

## 3) Science Story (human language)
1) State comes before story: regulate before reframe; appropriateness over volume.  
2) Two-speed engine: Journeys install baseline; NaviCues protect the moment.  
3) Identity from receipts: stack micro-proofs until belief updates.  
4) Closed loop, not content: READ/ROUTE/DELIVER/SEAL with governed primitives.  
5) Measurement as dignity: ATLAS stack (State, Action, Receipt, Transfer, Trajectory) with MTTR as gravity.  
6) Safety/escalation: change dose → change target → invoke human → invoke safety rails; humans when humans matter.

## 4) Capabilities (as system, not brochure)
- Journeys — baseline installed (weekly neuroplastic loops: ERA rhythm).  
- NaviCues — the moment protected (contracted micro-interventions).  
- LUMA — orchestration you can trust (why this, why now; governed delivery).  
- Proof — receipts that change identity (Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory).  
- ATLAS — measurement that matters (state/action/receipt/transfer/trajectory + MTTR).  
- Escalation — humans when humans matter (deterministic escalation; capacity-aware).  
- Data Dignity — quiet by default; consent by design; proof without punishment.  
- Audio (Spark/Flame/Ember) — timing infrastructure, not media.

## 5) New Installs (kernel pieces now explicit)
1) **Mindblock Studio** — atomic endpoints; prediction rules; heat suitability; primitive; stance; proof + transfer; contraindications; versioning.  
2) **Contract Compiler** — no asset ships without contract (target + primitive + proof + transfer); gating at publish.  
3) **Resistance Engine (ρ) + Escalation Router** — hesitation/abandon/no-shift detection; visible queue; protocol: change delivery → change target → human → safety rails.  
4) **Connector Hub + Consent/Permission Layer** — context, not surveillance; purpose-bound consent; quiet hours; connector-triggered loops (prep → event → receipt → transfer test).  
5) **Support Graph** — roles (witness/peer/clinician/safety), visibility, purpose-bound permissions, escalation routing with dignity.  
6) **Evidence Product** — accreditation mapping, transfer verification, MTTR curves, audit logs; defensibility as product.  
7) **Practice Foundation Ops** — sessions, scheduling, billing, records, mirror practice; decide native vs integrated rails.

## 6) Placement Map (where it lives)
**Marketing Site**
- Home: Loop + Proof stack + MTTR; humans when humans matter.  
- How it works: contracts; resistance as data; system simplifies under pressure.  
- Proof: Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory; MTTR tie-in.  
- Technology: state-first; governed delivery; closed-loop learning; LUMA vow.  
- Trust: quiet by default; consent; proof without punishment.  
- For Individuals/Pros/Orgs: altitude-specific heroes with same spine.  

**Product Surfaces**
- Companion: Navigate → Connector Hub; People → Support Graph; Cue/Move/Receipt; Routing Receipt (why now); Safety/Escalation.  
- Console: Clinical Studio → Mindblock Studio; Contract Compiler at publish; Signal → Escalation Queue; Context Streams (consented); Practice Foundation.  
- Command Center: Evidence (accreditation mapping, transfer verification, MTTR curves, integrity logs); Capacity/Escalation load.  

## 7) Trust Boundary (LUMA Vow)
**LUMA will:** read the moment; route the next move inside a governed spine; explain why this/why now; protect cadence; seal progress with proof; escalate to humans when humans matter.  
**LUMA will never:** replace the relationship; pressure the person; trade dignity for data.  
Close: The intelligence is not the point. Trust is.

## 8) Brand OS (voice + taglines)
- Cadence: Claim → Human truth → Inevitable outcome. Short lines, verbs, no defense, no hype.  
- Words we own: Return, Receipts, Timing, Hold, Appropriate, Continuity, Proof, Transfer, Trajectory, Dignity, Governed, Quiet, Scale with integrity.  
- Ban in public: app/platform/chatbot/engagement/compliance/tracking/streaks/gamified/content library/AI-powered.  
- Tagline tiers:  
  - Flag: Recovery — now runs in real life.  
  - Page truths (pick one): Built for timing. The layer that helps change hold. Proof, without punishment. Continuity — built in. Your work — extended. Stay oriented.  
  - Three-line stacks: Stay oriented. Make the move. Keep the proof. / Read the moment. Route the dose. Seal the return. / Quiet guidance. Real receipts. Default forming.  
- UI laws: one primary action; state then story; never punish drift; proof over praise; silence is a feature; one-line explainability; every screen closes the loop; no streaks/leaderboards; humans when humans matter.

## 9) Design System Highlights
- Themes: Luminous (clarity, morning); Night-Lux (calm authority, default).  
- Semantic tokens: bg/surface/text/muted/accent/receipt/drift/safety + state-calm/heat/fracture/repair.  
- Spacing scale: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64.  
- Motion: 150–220ms, bezier(.2,.8,.2,1), no bounce; motion as breath.  
- Components: Buttons (verb-first), Cards (truth line + one action), Cue, Move, Receipt, Proof strip, Return CTA, Why this/why now, Escalation card, Check-in.  
- State rules:  
  - CALM: options ok; reflection allowed.  
  - HEAT: single CTA; minimal language; short move.  
  - FRACTURE: remove choice; human-forward; grounding.  
  - REPAIR: seal proof; gentle next step.  
- Accessibility: AA contrast; min 16px body; 44px targets; reduced motion support.

## 10) Copy Library (sacred phrases)
- A quick return? / Make a return.  
- Receipt of Return / Held in the wild / Default forming.  
- Bring in a human.  
- Nothing to prove today. That is allowed.  
- Keep it simple. One move is enough.  
- Not now is data. We will reroute.

## 11) Decisions to Lock
- Practice Foundation: native rails vs integrations (and required adapters/audit).  
- Naming/ID policy: lock taxonomy slugs across UI/CMS/LUMA/export.  
- Palette finalization: set accent/receipt/drift/safety tokens per theme.  
- Resistance Engine signals: canonical detection set + thresholds.  
- Contract schema: required fields per asset (target, primitive, stance, proof, transfer, contraindications, heat suitability).  
- Connector permissions: per integration, data-class, purpose, time window, retention.  
- Support graph roles and visibility defaults.  
- Escalation protocols: deterministic steps and ownership.

## 12) Build Plan
**P0 (makes OS run):** Mindblock canonical set + Studio + versioning; Contract Compiler enforcement; Resistance Engine + Escalation objects/queue.  
**P1 (makes it real-world):** Closed-loop comms layer; Connector permissions + context adapters; Support graph unified with consent + escalation.  
**P2 (makes it unfair):** Evidence Product (accreditation mapping, payer exports); Practice Foundation decision + adapters; LUMA routing receipts as first-class artifact.

## 14) QA Gate (ship checklist)
- State targeted? (Calm/Heat/Fracture/Repair).  
- Exactly one primary action?  
- Contract attached? (proof + transfer).  
- Why this/why now present?  
- Receipts created on completion?  
- Drift not punished?  
- Escalation path clear?  
- Dignity preserved (no streaks/shame)?

## 15) Closing Truth
**Recovery — now runs in real life.**  
Built for timing. Proof without punishment. Humans when humans matter. Trust as the foundation.
