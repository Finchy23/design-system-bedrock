# Clinician Review Pack

**CLINICIAN REVIEW PACK v0.2**

*Systemised map from Problem → Mechanism → Schema → Family → Mindblock → Proof → Transfer*

Goal: a clean, conference-legible map from Problem → Mechanism → Schema → Family → Mindblock → Proof → Transfer. So a neuroscientist can audit it. A clinician can trust it. A person can live it.

Locked rules: Mechanism is the medicine · Approach is the delivery method · Voice is the bedside manner.

First move before skills: Introspection → Insight → Struggle → Breakthrough (the backstory map).

# 0) The Spine (What We’re Building)

This pack defines a deterministic, auditable change pipeline. Every unit of content and every interaction must be traceable through the same spine:

- Problem (what’s breaking)
- Mechanism (what changes biology/behavior)
- Schema (the default prediction engine)
- Family (expression clusters of the schema)
- Mindblock (atomic endpoint: the smallest if-X-then-Y prediction you can target, test, and rewrite)
- Proof (receipts that make change auditable)
- Transfer (tests that show it holds in a new context)

## 0.1 Canonical Definitions

Definitions are written to preserve your non-presumptuous stance: these are patterns, not verdicts.

- Schema = the person’s default model of what will happen. Not a label. A risk forecast.
- Family = expression clusters. Same schema, different costumes.
- Mindblock = atomic endpoint. The smallest testable prediction statement.
- Proof + Transfer = where it becomes real. Receipts and transfer tests make change auditable, not inspirational.

## 0.2 Pillars (Physiology → Identity)

Your clinical map anchors six pillars (Onboarding remains a system wrapper, not a clinical pillar).

- Emotional Regulation
- Stress Resilience
- Social Connectivity
- Cognitive Reframing
- Identity Integration
- Decision Mastery

# 1) The Governed Delivery Layer (So Clinicians Don’t Flinch)

## 1.1 Voices (Conference‑Legible Clinical Stances)

Voice taxonomy is not “personalities.” It is clinical stance. Use as routing dimensions (heat + schema risk + KBE).

- Clinician (Attuned Therapist)
- Compassionate Witness
- Coach (Agency Builder)
- Sage (Perspective Shifter)
- Paradox (Pattern Breaker)
- Nurturer (Co‑regulator)
- Straight Talk (Reality Anchor)
- Elder (Integrity / Values)

## 1.2 Approaches (The Move Library)

- Statement mirror
- Belief probe
- Somatic scan
- Paradox prompt
- Make‑one‑move
- Receipt capture
- Transfer test
- Repair script
- Witness reflection

## 1.3 Heat Bands + KBE Targets

Use RED/AMBER/GREEN gating so you don’t “think” in a fire. Then route by KBE:

- Knowing (map the loop)
- Believing (the shift lands)
- Embodying (proof + transfer)

# 2) The Canonical Schema List (v1.0) — Predictive Patterns, Not Diagnoses

A final, tight set of schemas that cover the clinical space (schema‑therapy compatible, predictive‑processing friendly, usable in recovery contexts without diagnosis theatre).

**S1) Immediate Relief —** “When I feel this, I must end it now.” Short horizon. High urgency. Cheap comfort wins.

**S2) Defectiveness / Shame —** “If you really saw me, you’d leave.” Hide. Perform. Pre‑emptively self‑attack.

**S3) Abandonment / Disconnection —** “People go. Safety doesn’t last.” Cling, test, or detach first.

**S4) Mistrust / Harm —** “Care is a trap.” Hypervigilance. Motive scanning. No softness.

**S5) Control / Perfection —** “If I loosen, everything breaks.” Rigid standards. Micromanage. Rest must be earned.

**S6) Emotional Deprivation —** “Needs don’t get met, so don’t have them.” Silent longing. Resentment. Pseudo‑independence.

**S7) Social Isolation / Not Belonging —** “They don’t want me. I don’t fit.” Withdraw. Mask. Surface connection only.

**S8) Unworthiness / Not Enough —** “I’m behind. I’m less.” Comparison loops. Approval hunger. Collapse after effort.

**S9) Failure —** “If I try, I’ll prove I can’t.” Avoid. Self‑handicap. Quit early.

**S10) Helplessness / Powerlessness —** “Nothing I do changes it.” Freeze. Start delay. External locus lock.

**S11) Dependence / Incompetence —** “I can’t do life alone.” Outsource decisions. Panic when solo. Responsibility collapse.

**S12) Subjugation —** “If I say no, I lose love.” Appease → build resentment → explode.

**S13) Approval Seeking —** “Being liked is being safe.” Over‑explain. Reassurance loops. Perform for belonging.

**S14) Reactance / Defiance —** “Don’t control me — I’ll prove I’m free.” Pushback on help. Rule‑breaking as identity.

**S15) Unsafe World —** “The world is dangerous; I must stay on guard.” Threat bias. Safety behaviours. Avoidance locks fear in.

**S16) Negativity / Doom Bias —** “Something bad is coming.” Rumination engine. Hope dampening. Catastrophic forecasting.

**S17) Emotional Intolerance —** “These feelings will destroy me.” Escalate, dissociate, numb, flee.

**S18) Self‑Punishment —** “I must pay for being me.” Atonement through pain. Success sabotage. Relapse as penalty.

**S19) Role‑Self / Mask —** “My role is safer than my self.” Image management. No vulnerability. Status‑loss threat.

**S20) Disconnection From Meaning —** “Nothing matters.” Drift mode. Purpose deflation. Self‑neglect spiral.

- Slot B — Prediction variants: danger forecast; rejection forecast; shame forecast; loss-of-control forecast; meaninglessness forecast
- Slot C — Coping move variants: avoid; numb; attack; appease; overcontrol

- Slot E — Proof variants: timer receipt; voice soundbite receipt; message sent receipt; attendance receipt; transfer test receipt

# 8) The “10th Point” Lock — Reality Conditions & Safety

- The willingness gate: the system can deliver the next inch, but it can’t want it for someone.
- Resistance is a living signal (ρ): not failure; a routing signal (wrong dosage, wrong voice, wrong target, or ‘we need a human’).
- Escalation protocol: change delivery → change target → invoke human → invoke safety rails.
- LUMA boundary: guiding intelligence inside governed infrastructure, not freeform therapy chat.
- Closed-loop comms + connector layer: prep cue → in-moment cue → post-event receipt → transfer.
- Outside-world connectors must be context, not surveillance.
- Data dignity: no ranking humans against humans; no shame charts; data exists to return you to yourself.

# 9) Implementation Requirements (Schema Support Needed Next)

- Resistance signals (hesitation, abandon, no-shift patterns)
- Escalation protocols (reason, target, outcome)
- Support network graph + consent scoping
- Closed-loop comms (notification → action → proof)
- Connector permissions (health/meetings/community)
- Data dignity rules (no ranking humans)
