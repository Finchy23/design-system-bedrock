# Page Copy — Choose Your World

**Hero**  
Where do you run recovery?  
One OS. Three ways to run it.  
CTA: Choose your world

**Individual — Companion**  
Stay oriented. The moment layer that meets drift with Cue → Move → Receipt. Return history (MTTR). Support Graph (roles/consent). Connector Hub (purpose-bound). Quiet by default.  
CTA: Start with Companion

**Professionals — Console**  
Your work — extended. Signal, not noise: what held, what slipped, return speed. Mindblock Studio (atomic endpoints), Contract Compiler (proof + transfer), Escalation queue (ρ), Practice rails.  
CTA: Explore the Console

**Organisations — Command Center**  
Continuity — built in. Cohort MTTR curves. Transfer verification. Evidence/Accreditation mapping. Integrity logs. Escalation load/capacity.  
CTA: See the Command Center

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Proof without punishment. Humans when humans matter.
