**The gap**  
Life doesn’t wait. Neither does recovery.  
The hardest seconds don’t arrive on schedule. The system runs when life is loud.

**The loop**  
READ → ROUTE → DELIVER → SEAL.  
State-first. Appropriate dose. Delivered in the right voice. Sealed with proof.

**Proof + MTTR**  
Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return speed is the skill.

**Humans when humans matter**  
When the loop doesn’t hold: change dose → change target → bring in a human → safety rails.  
Infrastructure protects care. It doesn’t replace it.
