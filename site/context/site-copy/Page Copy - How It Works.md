# Page Copy — How it works (Recoverlution)

**Hero**  
Built for timing.  
The right thing at the right time, in the right dose — with proof.

**Principle**  
State comes before story. Timing is the intervention.

**The loop**  
READ: state, readiness, resistance (ρ).  
ROUTE: target + dose (schema/family/mindblock → stance/primitive → proof + transfer ask).  
DELIVER: Journeys (weekly installs) + NaviCues (moment moves), conducted by LUMA with “why this, why now.”  
SEAL: Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory; MTTR tracked across surfaces.

**Two-speed engine**  
Journeys raise baseline. NaviCues protect the moment. Two speeds, one engine.

**Proof as currency**  
Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory. Proof without punishment; identity changes from evidence.

**Measurement**  
ATLAS stack: State, Action, Receipt, Transfer, Trajectory.  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return gets faster; baseline steadies.

**Escalation**  
Deterministic protocol: change delivery → change target → invoke human → safety rails. Capacity-aware. Humans when humans matter.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking. Cadence and quiet hours respected.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Governed. Explainable. Measurable.
