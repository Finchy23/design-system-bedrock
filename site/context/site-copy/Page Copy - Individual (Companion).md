# Page Copy — Individual (Companion)

**Hero**  
Stay oriented.  
A quiet layer that meets you at the moment of drift — and guides the return.  
CTA: Start with Companion

**The moment matters**  
When heat rises, choice shrinks. The system meets that second with one move, not noise.

**Cue → Move → Receipt**  
A quick return? 30 seconds. One move. Seal with a receipt.

**Return history (MTTR)**  
Return is the skill. Return gets faster; baseline steadies. Proof without punishment.

**Support Graph**  
Your people, with purpose and consent. Roles: Witness, Peer, Safety, Clinician. Visibility you control.

**Connector Hub**  
Context, not surveillance. Purpose-bound connections (timing, prep, proof of transfer). Quiet hours respected.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. One move. One receipt. Return becomes default.
