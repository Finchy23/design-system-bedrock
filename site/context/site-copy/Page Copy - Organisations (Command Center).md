**Hero**  
Continuity — built in.  
Closed-loop recovery infrastructure that makes outcomes legible and defensible.  
CTA: See the Command Center

**Discharge is a handoff, not an ending**  
Continuity can’t be optional. The loop holds outside the building.

**Outcomes that stand up**  
Cohort MTTR curves (return speed). Transfer verification (held post-discharge). Defensibility you can present.

**Evidence product**  
Accreditation mapping. Payer-ready exports. Integrity logs. Proof without theatre.

**Capacity and escalation load**  
Human load visible and governable. Deterministic escalation protects clinicians and clients.

**Governance**  
Consent and cadence rules. Delivery reliability. Audit-ready posture. Quiet by default.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Scale with integrity. Outcomes you can defend.
