# Page Copy — Professionals (Console)

**Hero**  
Your work — extended.  
Continuity that carries your standard between sessions — so your impact compounds.

**The gap is the enemy**  
Sessions don’t fail. The gap fails. The system keeps continuity running between appointments.

**Signal, not noise**  
What held. What slipped. Return speed (MTTR). No reconstruction. No engagement theatre.

**Mindblock Studio + Contract Compiler**  
Atomic endpoints with governed delivery: target + primitive + proof + transfer. No move ships without a contract.

**Escalation queue (ρ)**  
Resistance is routing data. Deterministic escalation: change delivery → change target → bring in a human → safety rails.

**Practice rails**  
Sessions, scheduling, billing, records, mirror practice — on rails or integrated.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Proof without punishment. Clinically legible, human in tone.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Your standard holds. Your time returns. Your impact compounds.
