# Page Copy — Proof (Recoverlution)

**Hero**  
Proof, without punishment.  
Receipts that reinforce return — until change holds.

**The proof stack**  
Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
Receipt: evidence the move happened.  
Transfer: evidence it held in life.  
Trajectory: evidence it’s becoming default.

**MTTR tie-in**  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return gets faster; baseline steadies.

**Use-cases by world**  
- Individual (Companion): Identity from receipts; belief changes because evidence does.  
- Professional (Console): Signal, not stories; clinically legible proof.  
- Organisation (Command Center): Defensibility; outcomes that stand up under scrutiny.

**Examples (tone)**  
Receipt of Return — Returned in 48 seconds.  
Held in the wild — Evidence it held outside the app.  
Trajectory — Default forming.

**Why it matters**  
When progress is visible, it becomes livable. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Proof is the currency. MTTR is the gravity.
