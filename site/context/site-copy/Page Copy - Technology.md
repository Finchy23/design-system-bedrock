**State-first computing**  
The system reads state before it speaks. State isn’t judgement; it’s routing.

**Governed delivery**  
Every move ships with a contract: target + primitive + proof + transfer. Cadence rules. Quiet hours. No drift.

**LUMA vow**  
LUMA is governed intelligence inside the recovery spine.  
Why this, why now — in one line. Appropriate, not improvised.

**Closed-loop learning**  
Return gets faster because the system reinforces what worked. No novelty chasing; no noise.

**Trust boundary**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking. Humans when humans matter.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Governed. Explainable. Measurable.
