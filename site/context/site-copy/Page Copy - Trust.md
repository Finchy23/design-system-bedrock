# Page Copy — Trust (Data Dignity)

**Hero**  
Trust, by design.  
Recovery only works when it feels safe enough to use in real moments.  
CTA: Read the vow · Talk to us

**Principle**  
Dignity isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation. Voluntary signal is higher signal.

**Quiet by default**  
No urgency theatre. No streak pressure. Support should feel like relief, not noise.

**Consent by design**  
People choose what they share, how they’re contacted, and when. Purpose-bound consent; quiet hours honored.

**Proof without punishment**  
Receipts exist to reinforce return, not to rank humans. Proof is reinforcement, not performance.

**Humans when humans matter**  
Escalation is built in: when the loop doesn’t hold, the system brings the right human at the right time.

**Governance rules (plain)**  
Cadence rules · Timing rules · Quiet hours · Escalation rules · Delivery contracts · Auditability.

**LUMA vow (restate)**  
Will: read the moment; route inside a governed spine; explain why this/why now; protect cadence; seal proof; escalate to humans.  
Will never: replace the relationship; pressure the person; trade dignity for data.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Precision without pressure. Trust is the foundation.
