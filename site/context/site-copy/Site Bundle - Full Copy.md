## Home
**Hero**  
Recovery — now runs in real life.  
A living layer that reads the moment, routes the right move, and proves it held.  
CTAs: Choose your world · See how it works

**The gap**  
Life doesn’t wait. Neither does recovery.  
The hardest seconds don’t arrive on schedule. The system runs when life is loud.

**The loop**  
READ → ROUTE → DELIVER → SEAL.  
State-first. Appropriate dose. Delivered in the right voice. Sealed with proof.

**Proof + MTTR**  
Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return speed is the skill.

**Humans when humans matter**  
When the loop doesn’t hold: change dose → change target → bring in a human → safety rails.  
Infrastructure protects care. It doesn’t replace it.

## How it works
**Hero**  
Built for timing.  
The right thing at the right time, in the right dose — with proof.

**Principle**  
State comes before story. Timing is the intervention.

**The loop**  
READ: state, readiness, resistance (ρ).  
ROUTE: target + dose (schema/family/mindblock → stance/primitive → proof + transfer ask).  
DELIVER: Journeys (weekly installs) + NaviCues (moment moves), conducted by LUMA with “why this, why now.”  
SEAL: Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory; MTTR tracked across surfaces.

**Two-speed engine**  
Journeys raise baseline. NaviCues protect the moment. Two speeds, one engine.

**Proof as currency**  
Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory. Proof without punishment; identity changes from evidence.

**Measurement**  
ATLAS stack: State, Action, Receipt, Transfer, Trajectory.  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return gets faster; baseline steadies.

**Escalation**  
Deterministic protocol: change delivery → change target → invoke human → safety rails. Capacity-aware. Humans when humans matter.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking. Cadence and quiet hours respected.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Governed. Explainable. Measurable.

## Proof
**Hero**  
Proof, without punishment.  
Receipts that reinforce return — until change holds.  
CTA: See Proof · Talk to us

**The proof stack**  
Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
Receipt: evidence the move happened.  
Transfer: evidence it held in life.  
Trajectory: evidence it’s becoming default.

**MTTR tie-in**  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return gets faster; baseline steadies.

**Use-cases by world**  
- Individual (Companion): Identity from receipts; belief changes because evidence does.  
- Professional (Console): Signal, not stories; clinically legible proof.  
- Organisation (Command Center): Defensibility; outcomes that stand up under scrutiny.

**Examples (tone)**  
Receipt of Return — Returned in 48 seconds.  
Held in the wild — Evidence it held outside the app.  
Trajectory — Default forming.

**Why it matters**  
When progress is visible, it becomes livable. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Proof is the currency. MTTR is the gravity.

## Technology
**Hero**  
Built for timing.  
Innovation that feels simple — because it’s appropriate.  
CTA: See how it works · Talk to us

**State-first computing**  
The system reads state before it speaks. State isn’t judgement; it’s routing.

**Governed delivery**  
Every move ships with a contract: target + primitive + proof + transfer. Cadence rules. Quiet hours. No drift.

**LUMA vow**  
LUMA is governed intelligence inside the recovery spine.  
Why this, why now — in one line. Appropriate, not improvised.

**Closed-loop learning**  
Return gets faster because the system reinforces what worked. No novelty chasing; no noise.

**Trust boundary**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking. Humans when humans matter.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Governed. Explainable. Measurable.

## Trust (Data Dignity)
**Hero**  
Trust, by design.  
Recovery only works when it feels safe enough to use in real moments.  
CTA: Read the vow · Talk to us

**Principle**  
Dignity isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation. Voluntary signal is higher signal.

**Quiet by default**  
No urgency theatre. No streak pressure. Support should feel like relief, not noise.

**Consent by design**  
People choose what they share, how they’re contacted, and when. Purpose-bound consent; quiet hours honored.

**Proof without punishment**  
Receipts exist to reinforce return, not to rank humans. Proof is reinforcement, not performance.

**Humans when humans matter**  
Escalation is built in: when the loop doesn’t hold, the system brings the right human at the right time.

**Governance rules (plain)**  
Cadence rules · Timing rules · Quiet hours · Escalation rules · Delivery contracts · Auditability.

**LUMA vow (restate)**  
Will: read the moment; route inside a governed spine; explain why this/why now; protect cadence; seal proof; escalate to humans.  
Will never: replace the relationship; pressure the person; trade dignity for data.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Precision without pressure. Trust is the foundation.

## Choose your world
**Hero**  
Where do you run recovery?  
One OS. Three ways to run it.  
CTA: Choose your world

**Individual — Companion**  
Stay oriented. The moment layer that meets drift with Cue → Move → Receipt. Return history (MTTR). Support Graph (roles/consent). Connector Hub (purpose-bound). Quiet by default.  
CTA: Start with Companion

**Professionals — Console**  
Your work — extended. Signal, not noise: what held, what slipped, return speed. Mindblock Studio (atomic endpoints), Contract Compiler (proof + transfer), Escalation queue (ρ), Practice rails.  
CTA: Explore the Console

**Organisations — Command Center**  
Continuity — built in. Cohort MTTR curves. Transfer verification. Evidence/Accreditation mapping. Integrity logs. Escalation load/capacity.  
CTA: See the Command Center

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Built for timing. Proof without punishment. Humans when humans matter.

## Individual (Companion)
**Hero**  
Stay oriented.  
A quiet layer that meets you at the moment of drift — and guides the return.  
CTA: Start with Companion

**The moment matters**  
When heat rises, choice shrinks. The system meets that second with one move, not noise.

**Cue → Move → Receipt**  
A quick return? 30 seconds. One move. Seal with a receipt.

**Return history (MTTR)**  
Return is the skill. Return gets faster; baseline steadies. Proof without punishment.

**Support Graph**  
Your people, with purpose and consent. Roles: Witness, Peer, Safety, Clinician. Visibility you control.

**Connector Hub**  
Context, not surveillance. Purpose-bound connections (timing, prep, proof of transfer). Quiet hours respected.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. One move. One receipt. Return becomes default.

---
## Professionals (Console)
**Hero**  
Your work — extended.  
Continuity that carries your standard between sessions — so your impact compounds.  
CTA: Explore the Console

**The gap is the enemy**  
Sessions don’t fail. The gap fails. The system keeps continuity running between appointments.

**Signal, not noise**  
What held. What slipped. Return speed (MTTR). No reconstruction. No engagement theatre.

**Mindblock Studio + Contract Compiler**  
Atomic endpoints with governed delivery: target + primitive + proof + transfer. No move ships without a contract.

**Escalation queue (ρ)**  
Resistance is routing data. Deterministic escalation: change delivery → change target → bring in a human → safety rails.

**Practice rails**  
Sessions, scheduling, billing, records, mirror practice — on rails or integrated.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Proof without punishment. Clinically legible, human in tone.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Your standard holds. Your time returns. Your impact compounds.

---
## Organisations (Command Center)
**Hero**  
Continuity — built in.  
Closed-loop recovery infrastructure that makes outcomes legible and defensible.  
CTA: See the Command Center

**Discharge is a handoff, not an ending**  
Continuity can’t be optional. The loop holds outside the building.

**Outcomes that stand up**  
Cohort MTTR curves (return speed). Transfer verification (held post-discharge). Defensibility you can present.

**Evidence product**  
Accreditation mapping. Payer-ready exports. Integrity logs. Proof without theatre.

**Capacity and escalation load**  
Human load visible and governable. Deterministic escalation protects clinicians and clients.

**Governance**  
Consent and cadence rules. Delivery reliability. Audit-ready posture. Quiet by default.

**Close**  
Recovery — now runs in real life. Scale with integrity. Outcomes you can defend.
