## HOME
**Hero:** Recovery — now runs in real life.  
**Sub:** A living layer that reads the moment, routes the right move, and proves it held.  
**CTAs:** Choose your world · See how it works

**Intro block**  
Life doesn’t wait. Neither does recovery.  
The system runs when life is loud — and keeps proof.

**The Loop**  
READ → ROUTE → DELIVER → SEAL.  
State-first. Governed delivery. Proof without punishment.

**Proof + MTTR**  
Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory.  
North star: MTTR — Mean Time To Return. Return speed is the skill.

**Humans when humans matter**  
When the loop doesn’t hold: change dose → change target → bring in a human → safety rails.

## HOW IT WORKS
**Built for timing.** The right thing at the right time, in the right dose, with proof.

- READ (state): heat, readiness, resistance (ρ).  
- ROUTE (target + dose): schema/family/mindblock → stance/primitive → proof request/transfer test.  
- DELIVER: Journeys (weekly install) + NaviCues (moment moves), conducted by LUMA with “why this, why now.”  
- SEAL: Action → Receipt → Transfer → Trajectory; MTTR tracked across surfaces.

**Two-speed engine**  
Journeys raise baseline. NaviCues protect the moment.

**Escalation**  
Deterministic: change delivery → change target → human → safety rails. Capacity-aware.

**Data dignity**  
Quiet by default. Consent by design. Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.

## PROOF
**Proof, without punishment.**  
- Receipt: evidence the move happened.  
- Transfer: evidence it held in life.  
- Trajectory: evidence it’s becoming default.  
**MTTR:** return gets faster; baseline steadies.

Use-cases:  
- Identity (Companion) — belief from receipts.  
- Signal (Console) — clinically legible proof.  
- Defensibility (Command Center) — outcomes you can defend.

## TECHNOLOGY
**Built for timing.**  
- State-first computing (READ before it speaks).  
- Governed delivery (Contract: target + primitive + proof + transfer; cadence rules).  
- LUMA vow: why this, why now; appropriate, not improvised.  
- Closed-loop learning: reinforce what worked; prevent drift.

---
## TRUST (DATA DIGNITY)
**Quiet by default. Consent by design.**  
- People choose what to share and how they’re contacted.  
- Proof is reinforcement, not ranking.  
- Humans when humans matter.  
**Principles:** cadence rules, quiet hours, consent scopes, auditability.

## CHOOSE YOUR WORLD
**Companion (Individual)**  
Stay oriented. Cue → Move → Receipt. MTTR view. Support Graph (roles/consent). Connector Hub (purpose-bound). Quiet by default.  
CTA: Start with Companion.

**Console (Professional)**  
Your work — extended. Signal, not noise: what held, what slipped, return speed. Mindblock Studio (atomic endpoints), Contract Compiler (proof + transfer), Escalation queue (ρ), Practice rails.  
CTA: Explore the Console.

**Command Center (Organisation)**  
Continuity — built in. Cohort MTTR curves, Transfer verification, Evidence mapping to standards, Integrity logs, Escalation load/capacity.  
CTA: See the Command Center.

## CAPABILITIES STRIP (REUSABLE)
Journeys — baseline installed.  
NaviCues — the moment protected.  
LUMA — orchestration you can trust.  
Proof — receipts that change identity.  
ATLAS — measurement that matters (state/action/receipt/transfer/trajectory + MTTR).  
Escalation — humans when humans matter.  
Data Dignity — quiet by default.

---
## TRUST BOUNDARY (LUMA VOW)
LUMA will: read the moment; route the next move inside a governed spine; explain why this/why now; protect cadence; seal proof; escalate to humans.  
LUMA will never: replace the relationship; pressure the person; trade dignity for data.

## TONE GUARDS
- One idea per line; verbs over nouns.  
- No streaks/engagement/gamified language.  
- Explainability in one line: why this, why now.  
- Proof without punishment; no praise/shame.
